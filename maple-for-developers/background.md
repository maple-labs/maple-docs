# The Maple Ecosystem
Maple is a decentralized corporate credit market. Maple provides capital to institutional borrowers through globally accessible fixed-income yield opportunities.

For Borrowers, Maple offers **transparent and efficient financing done entirely on-chain.**

* Institutions can leverage their reputation to borrow undercollateralized without constant fear of liquidation and margin calls.
* Borrowers access pools of capital governed by smart contracts and liaise with Pool Delegates to confidentially complete loan assessments.

For Liquidity Providers, Maple offers a **sustainable yield source through professionally managed lending pools.**

* Diversified exposure across premium borrowers with staked reserve assets from the Pool Delegate providing first loss capital protection against loan defaults.
* Set and forget solution with diligence outsourced to Pool Delegates.
* Interest is accrued and reinvested to enable capital to compound over time.

For Pool Delegates, Maple is a **vehicle to attract funding and earn fee revenue.**

* Maple is a new platform providing decentralized asset management infrastructure.
* Globally accessible pools enable increased AUM from varied liquidity sources to be provided to networks of premium, credit worthy borrowers.

# The Maple Protocol

**Liquidity Providers (LPs)** deposit funds into a Liquidity Pool in order to fund loans and earn yield. In return, they receive an LP token representing their share of the pool.

**Pool Delegates** are responsible for managing each pool. They perform due diligence and agree on terms with Borrowers using smart contracts. Pool Delegates are required to stake a specified reserve amount (decided and continuously updated by the protocol Governor) into their Pool to cover defaults, aligning their incentives with Liquidity Providers.

**Borrowers** request capital from the platform by creating a Loan (which holds collateral and receives funding) and inputting requested loan terms. Once these terms are agreed on with a Pool Delegate, Borrowers can withdraw the requested funds for a fixed term, at a fixed rate, and at a fixed collateralization level.

Holders of the Maple Token (MPL) participate in the following ways:

* Passive MPL Holders earn a portion of protocol fees if they have added funds to the xMPL protocol revenue sharing contract.
* As Maple moves towards full decentralization, MPL Holders will be able to submit proposals and vote on changes such as adding Pool Delegates and adjusting fees and staking parameters.
