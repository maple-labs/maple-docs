# WithdrawalManager (Queue)

### Overview

The process of withdrawing assets that have been deposited into a Maple pool is managed by the `WithdrawalManager`. This contract allows users to submit withdrawal requests and holds custody of their shares until the request is processed. Once the withdrawal request is processed the shares in custody will be exchanged for assets using the current exchange rate and then transferred to the owner of the shares.

### Withdrawal Request

Any user holding shares can perform a withdrawal request.

* Each withdrawal request has a unique identifier assigned to it
* Each user can only have one active withdrawal request at a time.
* When making the request the user specifies the amount of shares that should be redeemed and that amount of shares is then transferred to the withdrawal manager where it remains in custody.
* Once the withdrawal is processed the request is deleted and the user can again make another one.
* The user can also adjust an existing withdrawal request, but only in a downwards manner (by returning some of the shares locked).
* Additionally, the pool delegate or protocol admins also have the ability to remove any withdrawal request from the queue. This is primarily for the sake of preventing abuse of the withdrawal mechanism.

_NOTE_: Withdrawal requests can only be submitted in the form of redemption requests (indicating the number of shares to redeem), `requestWithdraw()` and `withdraw()` functions are disabled.

### Withdrawal Queue (FIFO)

The withdrawal queue contains all of the pending withdrawal requests and maintains their ordering from first to last. Whenever the pool delegate or protocol admins decide to process withdrawal requests, they will be processed in that order (**FIFO**). This means withdrawal requests that are made earlier will be processed before withdrawal requests that are made later. In case of insufficient liquidity, there may not be enough assets to process all withdrawal requests. In that case only some of the most recent requests will be processed, and the remainder will remain in the queue to be processed at a later time.

### Request Processing

The pool delegate or any of the protocol admins can at any time process any amount of shares that are pending redemption. The amount of shares to be processed is specified in advance, and as many redemption requests as possible will be processed using that amount of shares. The requests are processed based on their position in the queue (first to last), and using the current exchange rate.

_NOTE_: The `processRedemptions()` function has a reentrancy guard since it performs external calls.

_NOTE_: The amount of shares must be specified and are assumed to be a reasonable amount where out of gas issued don't occur.

### Exchange Rate

When a withdrawal request is processed, the amount of assets withdrawn is calculated by converting the requested shares into assets using the current exchange rate. This means that the exchange rate for different users' withdrawal requests may vary depending on when the requests are processed. If any loans have been impaired or are in the process of liquidation, the value of each share will decrease until the impairments and/or liquidations are finalized. Therefore, performing a withdrawal during a liquidation may result in a lower amount of assets being withdrawn compared to if the withdrawal occurs after the liquidation is finalized and some or all losses have been recovered.

The formula for calculating the exchange rate of shares to assets is defined as:

`exchangeRate = (totalAssets - unrealizedLosses) / totalSupply`

### Partial Redemptions

If there is insufficient liquidity available during the processing of a request, it will be processed partially (_note this is only applicable to the last request being processed in the queue_). This means that only a portion of the shares from the original withdrawal request will be redeemed. The remainder will retain their original position in the queue and may be processed again at any time. The formula for calculating the number of shares that can be redeemed is defined as follows:

`redeemableShares(user) = min(lockedShares(user), lockedShares(user) * availableAssets / requiredAssets)`

### Manual Requests (2 step process)

Each withdrawal request can be processed automatically (by default) or manually by calling `requestRedeem()` first then calling `redeem()`. The pool delegate or any protocol admin can enable manual requests for users who want to opt-out of automatic processing. The difference between automatic and manual requests is as follows:

* Automatic requests will be immediately redeemed on processing.
* Manual requests will be redeemed any time after processing (when the `redeem()` function is actually called). Manual withdrawal requests are primarily supported so that the protocol remains ERC-4626 compatible (mainly for integrators). Automatic requests are the default and preferred way of handling withdrawals.
* Pool Delegates are expected to be in touch with integrators to ensure they have manual requests enabled.

### Legacy Functions

For the sake of backwards compatibility with the `PoolManager`, certain functions used in the previous version of the withdrawal manager have been retained. These are as follows:

* `lockedShares()`: returns the amount of `manualSharesAvailable` (only used for manual withdrawals).
* `lockedLiquidity()`: returns zero, meaning it's at the pool delegate's discretion how much liquidity should be available for servicing withdrawals.
* `isInExitWindow()`: returns `true`, since there are no more withdrawal windows and withdrawals can be processed at any time.

### Key Assumptions

Generally a push pattern for token transfers is not recommended as it can lead to uncontrolled revert conditions. In the case of the `WithdrawalManager` this could mean issues such as the queue being blocked. This is a known issue and to address this we have added the `removeRequest()` function that can be called by the pool delegate or protocol admin to unblock the queue. Additionally:

* No tokens with callbacks will be used.
* This queue based withdrawal manager will only be used in permissioned pools, not public pools to avoid denial of service attacks.
* Extensive research will be done when onboarding new ERC20 tokens as the underlying asset.
* An LP being blacklisted by USDC/USDT is a low likelihood event due to the KYC'd nature of LPs in permissioned pools and the use of `removeRequest()` can address this issue.

To highlight the key reason to support this push pattern is to address the business need from LPs.

### Invariants

```
* Withdrawal Manager (Queue)
    * Invariant A: ∑request.shares + ∑owner.manualShares == totalShares
    * Invariant B: balanceOf(this) >= totalShares
    * Invariant C: ∀ requestId(owner) != 0 -> request.shares > 0 && request.owner == owner
    * Invariant D: nextRequestId <= lastRequestId + 1
    * Invariant E: nextRequestId != 0
    * Invariant F: requests(0) == (0, 0)
    * Invariant G: ∀ requestId[lender] ∈ [0, lastRequestId]
    * Invariant H: requestId is unique
    * Invariant I: lender is unique
```
