# Background

## The Maple Ecosystem

Maple is a leading digital asset lending platform, empowering the digital asset economy with secure, innovative lending solutions. Lending opportunities are tailored to meet diverse liquidity needs, risk appetites, and return expectations and facilitated through Mapleâ€™s technology to provide real time monitoring and transparency.

For Borrowers, Maple offers **transparent and efficient financing done entirely on-chain.**

For Liquidity Providers, Maple offers a **sustainable yield source through professionally managed lending pools supported by borrower underwriting, collateral analysis, and active risk management.**

## The Maple Protocol

**Liquidity Providers (LPs)** deposit funds into a Liquidity Pool in order to fund loans and earn yield. In return, they receive an LP token representing their share of the pool.

**Borrowers** request capital from the platform by creating a Loan (which holds collateral and receives funding) and inputting requested loan terms. Once these terms are agreed on with the Maple Direct team, Borrowers can withdraw the requested funds for a fixed term, at a fixed rate, and at a fixed collateralization level.
