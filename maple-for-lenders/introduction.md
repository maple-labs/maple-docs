# Introduction

Mapleâ€™s digital asset lending platform sources yield from secured loans to institutions. All loans from Maple pools are fully backed by select digital assets, which undergo rigorous risk assessment, and the permissioned nature of the yield source ensures both security and quality.&#x20;

Maple Blue Chip Secured pool provides the security of only accepting BTC and ETH collateral, held in qualified custody.&#x20;
