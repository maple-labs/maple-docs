# Introduction

Lending is the easiest way to earn with Maple Finance. Lenders deposit into a pool to earn interest denominated in the pool's liquidity asset. This interest is determined by the loan terms set by the pool delegate and borrowers.

Before lending, lenders will need to prepare the pool denominated asset (e.g. USDC, wETH) in their Ethereum wallet and ETH for gas payments. Lenders will not need MPL tokens to participate in lending.

**How to Lend**
