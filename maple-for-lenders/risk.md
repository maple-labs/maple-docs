# Risk

Maple is a technology services provider. Use of the Maple Protocol involves risks, including but not limited to Smart Contract Risk, Default Risk, and Risk of Loss.

### Smart Contract Risk

Smart contracts increase their risk profile with the amount of value they hold. The Maple team takes this threat very seriously and has audited the protocol code both internally and externally. The most recent version of the smart contracts has been audited by [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/), [Three Sigma](https://threesigma.xyz/labs/code-audits) and [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/).

### Default Risk

Maple is not a lender, but the Maple Protocol facilitates undercollateralized lending, and undercollateralized lending by nature carries a risk of defaults. Traditionally, lenders take borrowers through an underwriting process to mitigate this risk. Lending protocols available in DeFi today, such as Aave and Compound, require overcollateralization in order to prevent defaults from occurring.

The Maple Protocol enables more capital efficient, undercollateralized lending to occur by allowing Pool Delegates to use their own rigorous underwriting system in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers. If a borrower defaults, however, there may be a significant or complete loss of assets.

### Risk of Loss

Holding, lending, or borrowing digital assets involves a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of complete loss of those assets.
