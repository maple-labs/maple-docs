# KYC

Maple performs Know-Your-Customer checks, which includes sanctions checks, on all borrowers and pool delegates across the platform, and lenders in permissioned pools.

As a condition precedent to deposit, all lender wallets are scanned for risk factors using TRM Labs. Lender wallets that hit on risks (including interaction with high risk counterparty wallets) are blocked.
