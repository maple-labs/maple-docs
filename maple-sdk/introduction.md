Depending on a Smart contract package structure, the SDK export might include different properties, such as `core`, `factory`, `initializer`, `deployer`, which can be accessible through the export. For example, the `openTermLoan` export includes the following properties:

```js
const openTermLoan = {
  core: openTermLoanImports.MapleLoan__factory,
  factory: openTermLoanImports.MapleLoanFactory__factory,
  initializer: openTermLoanImports.MapleLoanInitializer__factory,
};
```
