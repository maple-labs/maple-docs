# Withdrawal Process

Withdrawals from Maple are facilitated via a queue-based Withdrawal Manager.

**Queue-based Withdrawals**

Queue-based withdrawals are processed in a first-in, first-out process as liquidity becomes available. Lenders who request a withdrawal in a queue-based pool will make one transaction to be added to the withdrawal queue.

The Maple Direct team processes withdrawals, and the lent funds are sent directly to the Lenders' wallet(s), not requiring them to execute another transaction. Currently, withdrawals are processed on average in less than 24 hours.
