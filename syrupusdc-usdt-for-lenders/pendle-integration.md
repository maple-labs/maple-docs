# Pendle Integration

We’re excited to present our integration with [Pendle](https://app.pendle.finance/trade/points/0x373dc7be84fadebc2e879c98289fc662c6985946), enabling advanced yield opportunities and streamlined reward management for our users.

### How It Works

1. **USDC Yield and Rewards Tracking**
   * Pendle allows users to tokenize and trade the yield from assets, making it simple to track and claim rewards.
   * For syrupUSDC lenders:
     * **USDC Yield** is claimable directly on Pendle.
     * **Drips Rewards** earned from your activity are displayed and claimable within [app.maple.finance/earn](https://app.maple.finance/earn).
2. **Drips Allocation**
   * syrupUSDC checks Pendle rewards and ensures users’ earned Drips are up-to-date and accurate.
   * Drips are allocated based on activity in Pendle. Pendle deposits automatically earn a 5x Drips boost.
   * If you’d like to dive deeper into Pendle's features and how they work, check out their official documentation [here](https://docs.pendle.finance/home?utm_source=landing\&utm_medium=landing) or contact their team for further assistance.

### Notes for Users

We’ve designed this integration to be as seamless as possible, but it’s worth noting that:

* **Claim Timing**: Claiming USDC yield on Pendle will differ from claiming Drips on [app.maple.finance/earn](https://app.maple.finance/earn). Ensure you’re checking both platforms for the latest updates on your rewards.
* **Feedback and Support**: If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to contact us or Pendle for clarification. While we aim to address concerns promptly, we encourage you to first review the Pendle documentation for answers to common questions.

### Why This Matters

This integration unlocks new possibilities for managing your yield and rewards, offering:

* Enhanced liquidity options via Pendle.
* The ability to optimize your strategy across two robust platforms.

Let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions. We're committed to making your experience with Syrup and Pendle the best it can be!
