# Drips Rewards

**Drip Rewards Overview**

The introduction of the SYRUP token enhanced alignment within the Maple ecosystem and enabled the protocol to start capturing value from institutional credit markets through DeFi. Drips facilitated an innovative rewards program that enabled users to earn SYRUP by creating rewards for deposits and ecosystem participation.\
\
As the products matured, the Drips program has been phased out in favor of direct incentives for using syrupUSDC and syrupUSDT with ecosystem partners. You can see all opportunities on [Merkl](https://app.merkl.xyz/?search=syrup).

The final claim for Drips accumulated during Q4 2025 will be open between January 18, 2026 and February 18, 2026. You can claim by going to: [https://app.maple.finance/earn/rewards](https://app.maple.finance/earn/rewards)

#### FAQ

1. **Why did Drips rewards end?**\
   Drips successfully incentivized early adoption of syrupUSDC and syrupUSDT. As these products have matured, we’ve transitioned to partner-based rewards distributed via [Merkl](https://app.merkl.xyz/?search=syrup).
2. **When can I claim my Season 12 Drips?**\
   The claim window opens 18th Jan 2026 at 12pm UTC and closes February 18, 2026 at 3pm UTC. Your claimable amount will appear here once the window opens.
3. **What happens if I miss the claim deadline?**\
   Unclaimed Drips after 18th Feb 2026 cannot be claimed anymore. These rewards go back to the protocol treasury.
4. **How do I earn rewards now?**\
   Ecosystem partners continue offering rewards, distributed via Merkl. Visit the [Merkl app](https://app.merkl.xyz/?search=syrup) to view and claim partner rewards.
