# Drips Rewards

**Drip Rewards Overview**

The introduction of the SYRUP token enhanced alignment within the Maple ecosystem and enabled the protocol to start capturing value from institutional credit markets through DeFi.  Drips facilitate an innovative rewards program that enables users to earn SYRUP by creating rewards for participation.\
\
Please note that drips are only available on Ethereum.&#x20;

Each earning period for earning rewards is known as a Season, each lasting one quarter. Users accumulate Drips every 4h, with the rate established as 1 Drip per 1 USDC/USDT per day. Users can then perform actions that will increase this base rate, such as depositing into syrupUSDC & syrupUSDT using one of our wallet integration partners or using syrupUSDC & syrupUSDT throughout DeFi. These actions translate directly into boosted rewards for users.

#### Drips Claiming <a href="#drips-claiming" id="drips-claiming"></a>

Syrup users can  see exactly when they will be able to claim their $SYRUP tokens, earned with the Drips they collected. Drips recipients will be eligible to convert their Drips to SYRUP and staked SYRUP (stSYRUP).

The Drips campaign was launched as a way to incentivize early users to join and participate in the overall growth of Maple. It has been a massive success and spawned integrations with the largest DeFi players including OKX, Pendle, Morpho and Ether.fi.

All syrupUSDC minters qualify for Drips and can see their current Drips allocation, broken down per season, on [https://app.maple.finance/earn/drips](https://app.maple.finance/earn/drips). This also includes Pendle, Morpho and OKX users.

Each new claim window opens on the 18th at 12pm UTC the month after a season ends and closes on the 18th of the following month at 3am UTC.&#x20;

**$SYRUP token rewards unlock in full**. Unlocks are always at 12pm UTC. Once the tokens are unlocked, they will be instantly claimable without any vesting.

**Please note that the tokens are only claimable for one month after the claim starts.**  Unclaimed tokens are returned to the treasury.

**Drips continue throughout 2025**, with the program now having a quarterly distribution schedule.

**SYRUP tokens when claimed can automatically be staked**, which will let users participate in the growth of the Maple ecosystem.
