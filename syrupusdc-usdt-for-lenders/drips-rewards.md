# Drips Rewards

**Drip Rewards Overview**

The introduction of the SYRUP token enhanced alignment within the Maple ecosystem and enabled the protocol to start capturing value from institutional credit markets through DeFi. Drips facilitated an innovative rewards program that enabled users to earn SYRUP by creating rewards for participation.\
\
Please note that the Drips program has been phased out in favor of direct incentives.

Each earning period for earning rewards was known as a Season, each lasting one quarter. Users accumulated Drips every 4h, with the rate established as 1 Drip per 1 USDC/USDT per day. Users could then perform actions that will increase this base rate, such as depositing into syrupUSDC & syrupUSDT using one of our wallet integration partners or using syrupUSDC & syrupUSDT throughout DeFi. These actions translated directly into boosted rewards for users.

Drips followed the claim schedule outlined below. Please note that the final claim will be open between January 18, 2026 and February 18, 2026.
