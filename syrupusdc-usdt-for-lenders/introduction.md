#### Maple, syrupUSDC, and syrupUSDT Structure

SyrupUSDC and syrupUSDT enable direct access to Maple pools through an interface and smart contract router (refer to Technical Resources for further details). Maple established new unique pools for syrupUSDC and syrupUSDT to ensure that proceeds and risks are segmented from existing pools accessible to Maple customers. The legal structure has been created to reflect the segregation required between Maple, syrupUSDC, and syrupUSDT (refer to Legal section for more details).\

Maple Direct (the lending arm of Maple Finance) is responsible for the underwriting, structuring and management of the loans that are originated in the Maple pools that Syrup access. All loans that provide yield to syrupUSDC or syrupUSDT will be to creditworthy crypto-native institutions that post liquid digital assets as collateral.

Moreover, Maple's smart contracts and technology infrastructure monitor all loans in real time to ensure adherence to collateralization levels, loan terms and financial disclosures and provide transparency for users to verify directly.
