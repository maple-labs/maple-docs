# Fees

### **Fees**

**Origination Fees** are paid by the Borrowers as a percentage of their loan amount during loan funding and refinance operations.

There are two types of Origination Fees: the **Delegation Origination Fee**, paid to the Delegate, and the **Platform Origination Fee**, paid to the Maple Treasury.

**Borrower** **Fees** are paid by borrowers during loan payments and added to gross interest.

Borrower fees include the **Admin Fee**, paid to the Delegate, and the **Platform Fee**, paid to the Maple Treasury.

**Management Fees** are taken as a portion of gross interest paid by Borrowers when payments are made.

Management fees include the **Delegate Management Fee** and the **Protocol Management Fee**.

All categories of fees are paid to two actors:

1. The Pool Delegate that manages the pool that has funded the loan.
2. The Maple Treasury.

An important distinction is to understand which fees are set on the pool level and which fees are paid on the loan level.

All fees with the exception of the Delegate Origination and Admin Fee (Borrower Fee paid to Delegate) are set on the pool level. This means they will be charged to any borrower who is lent money from the pool.

The Delegate Origination and Admin Fee are set on the loan level. This allows the Delegate to leverage specific fees on specific loans for additional due diligence work required to originate the loan.
