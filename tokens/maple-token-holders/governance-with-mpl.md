# Governance with MPL and xMPL

As the Maple protocol moves towards full decentralization, MPL holders will be responsible for governance. MPL and xMPL holders can submit and vote on proposed changes to the protocol, including adjusting fees, use of Treasury revenues and other protocol level changes. If MPL holders don't want to participate in governance themselves, they'll have the option to delegate their voting rights.

If participants hold 25 MPL or xMPL in their wallet or have staked 25 MPL in any of the lending pools, they are eligible and invited to vote on all MIPs. To register to vote, head [here ](https://discord.com/channels/576728229449170954/916335495284396053)and complete prompts via Collab.Land.
