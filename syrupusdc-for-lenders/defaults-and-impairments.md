# Commitments

When lending to syrupUSDC or syrupUSDT, lenders have the option to commit their deposits for 3 or 6 months. Commitments helps the Maple team manage liquidity when issuing new loans. Committed deposits cannot be withdrawn until the commitment period ends.&#x20;

In exchange for choosing to do this, they will receive boosted Drips for the duration of their deposits. See the [Drips Rewards](https://app.maple.finance/earn/drips) page for more detailed information.
