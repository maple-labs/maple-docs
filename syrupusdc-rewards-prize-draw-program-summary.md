### How the Prize Draw Works

The syrupUSDC Rewards Prize Draw runs from May 1, 2025 to October 30, 2025, with winners announced in the first week of November. It's designed to reward users who deposit USDC and maintain their deposit. Here's how it works:

#### Earning Tickets

Every participant receives tickets that serve as entries into the prize draw:

* Initial Deposit Tickets: When you deposit USDC during the 30-day activation period (May 1-30, 2025), you'll earn tickets based on an exponential formula that rewards larger deposits
* Exponential Scaling: Your tickets scale exponentially with your deposit size, making larger deposits significantly more valuable
* Maintenance Tickets: Additional tickets accrue for each day you maintain your deposit in the pool

The more tickets you accumulate, the better your chances of winning prizes from the $500,000 USDC pool!

### Incredible Prizes Await

The $500,000 USDC prize pool is distributed across 13 winners:

* üèÜ One $300,000 USDC Grand Prize
* ü•à Two $50,000 USDC Silver Prizes

### How to Participate

Getting started is simple:

1. Visit [app.maple.finance/earn](https://app.maple.finance/earn) between May 1-30, 2025
2. Connect your wallet to the platform
3. Deposit at least $1,000 USDC (remember, larger deposits earn exponentially more tickets!)
4. Maintain your deposit for the duration of the campaign (until October 30, 2025)

### How Tickets Are Calculated

Tickets are awarded based on your deposit amount using an exponential formula that significantly rewards larger deposits. The more USDC you deposit, the disproportionately more tickets you'll receive, substantially boosting your chances of winning the $300,000 grand prize!

Additionally, you'll earn maintenance tickets for each day you keep your deposit in the pool, further increasing your odds of winning.
