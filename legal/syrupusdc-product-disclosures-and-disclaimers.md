# syrupUSDC Product Disclosures & Disclaimers

The syrupUSDC token is a product developed, issued, and managed exclusively by Maple Finance. It is not sponsored, endorsed, administered by, or otherwise associated with Circle Internet Financial, LLC or its related entities ("Circle"). The syrupUSDC token is not a stablecoin and is not backed by USDC; its value is derived from a dynamic pool of underlying loan assets managed through the Maple Protocol.

The yield associated with syrupUSDC is generated from interest payments on overcollateralized loans made to institutional borrowers and yield generated through supporting deployment strategies, including futures basis trading and DeFi liquidity provision. These supporting strategies carry risks distinct from lending activities, as described in the [syrupUSDC and syrupUSDT - Risks section](https://docs.maple.finance/legal/syrupusdc-and-syrupusdt-risks). All lending activities involve significant risk, including but not limited to credit risk, liquidity risk, borrower default, and the potential for partial or total loss of your principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and yields are not guaranteed.
