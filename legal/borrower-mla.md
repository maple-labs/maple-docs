# Borrower MLA

All borrowers sign a legal agreement prior to receipt of funds. This agreement ensures the legal right to pursue borrowers in the case of default.

The legal agreements have a venue for arbitration and/or litigation, and borrowers must waive objections to forum. When funds are recouped, participants are reimbursed in the following order, until funds are depleted: enforcement costs to Maple pursuant to the terms of the legal agreements; principal balance owed to Lenders, on a pro-rata basis as of the date of default; accrued interest owed to Lenders, on a pro-rata basis as of the date of default; fees owed to Maple.

For questions about KYC or legal agreements, please contact contact@maple.finance.
