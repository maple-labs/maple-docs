# Borrower MLA

Prior to the disbursement of any funds, all prospective borrowers sign a legal agreement (the “Agreement”) prior to receipt of funds. This agreement is legally binding, ensures the rights and obligations of the parties involved, including, but not limited to, the unequivocal right of the lender to pursue all available legal remedies against the borrower in the event of default.

The Agreement incorporates a forum selection clause and arbitration provision.  Further, as a condition precedent to receiving funds, borrowers are required to execute an irrevocable waiver of all and any obligations to forum.

In the event of default, the distribution of such recovered amounts is allocated as follows:

i) All reasonable and documented costs incurred by Maple, as explicitly defined in the Agreement.

ii) The outstanding principal balance owed to Lenders, to be distributed on a pro-rata basis calculated as of the date of default;

iii) Any and all accrued interest owed to Lenders, similarly to be distributed on a pro-rata basis calculated as of the date of default;

iv) Any fees owed to Maple, as expressly stipulated in the Agreement.
