# Interface Terms of Use

Last Modified: January 5, 2024

Welcome to the Maple website and Maple Interface. The Following Terms of Use govern user access to and use of [https://www.maple.finance/](https://www.maple.finance/) and app.maple.finance (collectively, the “Interface”). &#x20;

**1. Acceptance of the Terms of Use**

These terms of use are entered into by and between you (the “User”) and Maple Labs Pty Ltd (“Company,” “we,” or “us”). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, “Terms of Use”), govern User’s access to and use of the Interface located at app.maple.finance, including any content, functionality, subpages, and services offered on or through the Interface. The Interface provides access to the Maple protocol that facilitates a novel decentralized method for decentralized peer-to-pool crypto-asset liquidity provision (the “Protocol”), including an ability for Participants to serve in certain capacities or perform certain functionalities when interacting with the Protocol.

User must read the Terms of Use carefully before it starts to use the Interface. By using the Interface, or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use when this option is made available to the User, the User accepts and agrees to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, incorporated herein by reference. If the User does not want to agree to these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, or any documents applicable to them that are incorporated herein by reference, the User must not access or use the Interface. To the extent that there is a conflict between these Terms of Use and any applicable additional terms, these Terms will control unless expressly stated otherwise. If the User does not agree with these Terms of Use, that User may not visit or use the Interface.

This Interface is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. By using this Interface, the User represents and warrants that the User is at least the higher of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company in the User’s applicable jurisdiction or eighteen (18) years of age, and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If the User does not meet all of these requirements, the User must not access or use the Interface.

User and Company shall undertake in good faith with respect to each other’s rights and undertake with the other to do all things reasonably that are necessary or desirable to give effect to the spirit and intent of this Agreement. &#x20;

**2. Changes to the Terms of Use.**

We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Interface thereafter. However, any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set out in [Governing Law and Jurisdiction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14A\_4JfboIrv032uLxhVXU6HDEQTCZeUp/edit#bookmark=id.28h4qwu) will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice before the date the change is posted on the Interface.&#x20;

The User’s continued use of the Interface following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that the User accepts and agrees to the changes. The User is expected to check this page each time it accesses this Interface, so it is aware of any changes, as they are binding on the User.&#x20;

Notwithstanding the above, we will seek your consent to future modifications to the Terms of Use to the extent we are required to do so by law.

**3. Electronic Communication**

We may be required or choose to provide certain communications to User in written form. By agreeing to the Terms of Use, User consents to the delivery of those communications in electronic form, including e-mail or other electronic message.
User agrees that all terms and conditions, disclosures, or agreements provided by Company electronically satisfy any legal requirement such communications would satisfy if they were provided in non-electronic writing. User waives any rights to require an original, wet, non-electronic signature, to the extent that such waiver is not prohibited under applicable law.

**4. Accessing the Interface and User Security.**

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend this Interface, and any service or material we provide on the Interface, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Interface is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Interface, or the entire Interface, to those who access the Interface (“Participants”).

The User is responsible for both:

* Making all arrangements necessary for the User to have access to the Interface.
* Ensuring that all persons who access the Interface through the User’s internet connection are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.

To access the Interface or some of the resources it offers, the User may be asked to utilize certain Web3 capabilities, such as MetaMask or another crypto-asset wallet capable of interacting with the User’s web browser (“Web3 Utilities”). It is a condition of the User’s use of the Interface that all the information only operate such Web3 Utilities with a private key(s) that the User created or has the direct, explicit permission of the party who created the relevant private key(s). The User agree that all information it provides to interact with the Interface or otherwise, including, but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features on the Interface, is governed by our Privacy Policy, and the User consents to all actions we take with respect to the User’s information consistent with our Privacy Policy.

If the User utilizes a Web3 Utility that relies on a username, password, private key, or any other piece of information as part of its security procedures, the User must treat such information as confidential, and the User must not disclose that information to any other person or entity. The User also acknowledges that any identity linked to its Web3 Utility is personal to the User and agrees not to provide any other person with access to such identity while using this Interface or portions of it using its Web3 Utility. The User also agrees to ensure that it will lock or otherwise prevent its Web3 Utility from unauthorized use on this Interface at the end of each session. The User should use particular caution when accessing the Interface from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record the User’s password, private key, or other personal information.

We have the right to disable any identity associated with a Web3 Utility (such as that represented by a public address) on the Interface or to block any IP address from accessing the Interface at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, the User or that identity has violated any provision of these Terms of Use.

**5. Intellectual Property Rights.**

The Interface and its entire contents, features, and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof) are owned by the Company, its licensors, or other providers of such material and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Terms of Use, we grant the Users a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the Interface for personal use until such time as the Terms of Use terminate or expire or the User’s right to use or access the Interface is terminated.

The User must not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, download, store, or transmit any of the material on our Interface, except as follows:

* The User’s computer may temporarily store copies of such materials in RAM incidental to the User’s accessing and viewing those materials.
* The User may store files that are automatically cached by the User’s web browser for display enhancement purposes.
* The User may print or download one copy of a reasonable number of pages of the Interface for its own personal, non-commercial use and not for further reproduction, publication, or distribution.
* If we provide desktop, mobile, or other applications for download, the User may download a single copy to its computer or mobile device, provided the User agrees to be bound by our end user license agreement or other similar applicable agreement for such applications.

The User must not:

* Modify copies of any materials from this Interface.
* Use any illustrations, photographs, video or audio sequences, or any graphics separately from the accompanying text.
* Delete or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices from copies of materials from this Interface.

If the User wishes to make any use of material on the Interface other than that set out in this section, it should address its request to: info@maple.finance.

If the User prints, copies, modifies, downloads, or otherwise uses or provides any other person with access to any part of the Interface in breach of the Terms of Use, the User’s right to access the Interface will stop immediately and the User must, at our option, return or destroy any copies of the materials the User has made. No right, title, or interest in or to the Interface or any content on the Interface is transferred to the User, and all rights not expressly granted are reserved by the Company. Any use of the Interface not expressly permitted by these Terms of Use is a breach of these Terms of Use and may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws.

**6. Trademarks.**

The Company name, the terms “Maple” and “Maple DAO,” and all related names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of the Company or its affiliates or licensors. You must not use such marks without the prior written permission of the Company; provided, however, User is hereby granted permission and license to use the terms “Maple” and “Maple DAO” and any related names (excluding the Company name), logos (excluding the Company logo), product and service names, designs, and slogans in any way that they see fit so long as such usage is not done in a way that: (1) is deceitful, fraudulent, or manipulative, (2) implies any relationship between user and the Company beyond that reasonably typical of the administrator of an interface and its users, or (3) to cause confusion in any way to gain assets or crypto-assets of, or personal information about, another party other than that intended by the protocol (for example, you may not use the foregoing marks to execute phishing attacks, spearphishing attacks, social engineering, or in any way that may cause a party to transmit assets or crypto-assets to an unintended recipient or to reveal private information, like a private key or password). All other names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans on the Website and Interface are the trademarks of their respective owners.&#x20;

**7. Prohibited Uses.**

The User may access or use the Interface only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms of Use. The User agrees not to use or access the Interface:

* Otherwise attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Interface.

**8. Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination.**

We have the right to:

* Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Interface.&#x20;
* Terminate or suspend a User’s access to all or part of the Interface for any or no reason, including without limitation, any violation of these Terms of Use.

Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to cooperate fully with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone using or accessing the Interface. THE USER WAIVES AND HOLDS HARMLESS THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES, AGENTS, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING, OR TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

However, we cannot review interactions or activities before they are executed through the Interface, and, given the nature of blockchain and smart contract activity, cannot ensure prompt removal or rectification of objectionable interactions or activities after they have been executed. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, transactions, blockchain operations, or content provided by any Participant or third party. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY TO ANYONE FOR PERFORMANCE OR NON PERFORMANCE OF THE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION, NOR FOR ANY HARMS OR DAMAGES CREATED BY OTHERS’ INTERACTIONS WITH ANY BLOCKCHAIN UNDERLYING THE INTERFACE.&#x20;

**9. Reliance on Information Posted.**

The information presented on or through the Interface is made available solely for general information purposes. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information. Users should not take or refrain from taking any action based on any information contained on the Interface or any other information available, including but not limited to community calls, social media posts, articles, links to third-party content, Discord communications, or tutorials. All community communications from contributors to the ecosystem around the Company are independent of the Company, and we will not have and do not assume any responsibility for their actions or omissions. Any reliance the User places on such information is strictly at the User’s own risk, and as is common in the blockchain space, the User is assuming a high amount of risk related to others or technical harms when operating via the Interface. We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by the User or any other visitor to the Interface, by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents, or by the actions (or omissions) of others interacting with any underlying blockchain.

This Interface may include content provided by third parties, including materials provided by other users, bloggers, and third-party licensors, syndicators, aggregators, and/or reporting services. All statements and/or opinions expressed in these materials, and all articles and responses to questions and other content, other than the content provided by the Company, are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity providing those materials. These materials do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the Company. We are not responsible, or liable to the User or any third party, for the content or accuracy of any materials provided by any third parties.

Any of the material on the Interface may be out of date at any given time, and we are under no obligation to update such material.&#x20;

**11. Information About The User and The User’s Visits to the Interface.**

All information we collect on this Interface is subject to our Privacy Policy. By using the Interface, the User consents to all actions taken by us with respect to the User’s information in compliance with the Privacy Policy.&#x20;

**12. No Professional Advice.**

All information or content provided or displayed by the Interface is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional advice (including, without limitation, tax, legal, or financial advice). The User should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information or content displayed or provided on the Interface. The User should seek independent professional advice from an individual licensed and qualified in the area appropriate for such before the User makes any financial, legal, or other decisions involving the Interface. The User acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permissible by law, it has not relied on the Company or any other Participant for any professional advice related to its use of the Interface or interactions with the Protocol.

**13. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.**

The User understands that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the internet or the Interface will be free of viruses or other destructive code. The User is responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy the User’s particular requirements for (1) an appropriate Web3 Utility; (2) anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output; and (3) maintaining a means external to our site for any reconstruction of any lost data. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY A DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACK, VIRUSES, OR OTHER TECHNOLOGICALLY HARMFUL MATERIAL THAT MAY INFECT THE USER’S COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, DATA, OR OTHER PROPRIETARY MATERIAL DUE TO THE USER’S USE OF THE INTERFACE OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE INTERFACE OR TO THE USER'S DOWNLOADING OF ANY MATERIAL POSTED ON IT, OR ON ANY WEBSITE LINKED TO IT.

THE USER’S USE OF THE INTERFACE, ITS CONTENT, AND ANY OF ITS SERVICES IS AT THE USER’S SOLE RISK. THE INTERFACE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE, WE, NOR ANY PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY, MAKES, AND WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM, ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND RELATED TO THE INTERFACE (AND THE PROTOCOL), WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPLETENESS, SECURITY, RELIABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR AVAILABILITY OF THE INTERFACE. THE COMPANY AND ANY PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (1) ACCESS TO THE INTERFACE WILL BE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, WITHOUT DELAY, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR FREE FROM DEFECTS; (2) THAT THE INFORMATION CONTAINED OR PRESENTED ON THE INTERFACE IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE, COMPLETE, CONCISE, CURRENT, OR RELEVANT; (3) THAT THE INTERFACE WILL BE FREE FROM DEFECTS, MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, ERRORS, PRIVATE, OR ANY OTHER HARMFUL ELEMENTS, OR THAT ANY OF SUCH WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE INTERFACE WILL MEET THE USER’S EXPECTATIONS. NO INFORMATION OR STATEMENT THAT WE MAKE, INCLUDING DOCUMENTATION OR OUR PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS, SHOULD BE TREATED AS OFFERING ANY WARRANTY CONCERNING THE INTERFACE (OR AS A REPRESENTATION REGARDING THE PROTOCOL). WE DO NOT ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTENT, ADVERTISEMENTS, OFFERS, STATEMENTS, OR ACTIONS BY ANY THIRD PARTY EITHER REGARDING OR THROUGH THE INTERFACE. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

**14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USER'S USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE INTERFACE, THE PROTOCOL, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE INTERFACE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE. THIS DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXTENDS TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES CAUSED BY ANY THIRD PARTY OR ANY FAILURE OF THE PROTOCOL OR THE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAINS. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

**15. Nature of Blockchain; Assumption of Risk; Waiver of Claims.**

Blockchains and smart contracts are still emerging technologies that carry a high amount of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political, social, and personal safety standpoints. The mere access to and interaction with blockchains and smart contracts requires a high degree of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative degree of safety and proficiency. Crypto-assets are highly volatile in nature due to many diverse factors, including (without limitation) use and adoption, speculation, manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies (such as blockchains) is variable and highly volatile. Moreover, the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any interactions the User has with the Protocol may be publicly visible and readable in human form.&#x20;

By accessing and using the Interface, the User acknowledges the foregoing and agrees and represents that it understands such and other risks involved with blockchains and the Protocol. The User further represents that it has all knowledge sufficient to work, and is informed of all foreseeable risks, and the possibility of unforeseeable risks, associated with blockchains, crypto-assets, crypto mining, Web3 Utilities, smart contracts, and the Protocol. The User further acknowledges that any crypto-assets the User places or uses within the Protocol may increase or decrease in value rapidly while they are involved with the Protocol, or be obtained by other parties or otherwise lost in ways the User may or may not currently foresee (possibly to the User’s severe harm or detriment). The User agrees that the Company is not responsible for any of these (or related) risks, does not own or control the Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting harms, damages, or losses incurred by or against the User experiences while accessing or using the Interface. Accordingly, the User acknowledges the foregoing, represents its understanding of the foregoing, and agrees to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Interface and interacting with the Protocol, whether mentioned in this section or otherwise. The User further expressly waives and releases us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to the User’s use of the Interface and the User’s interaction with the Protocol. If the User is a California resident, the User waives the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which states: “\[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

**16. No Fiduciary Duties.**

This Agreement, and the provision of the Interface, is not intended to create any fiduciary duties between us and the User or any third-party. To the fullest extent permissible by law, the User agrees that neither the User’s use of the Interface or the Protocol causes us or any Participant to owe fiduciary duties or liabilities to the User or any third party. Further, the User acknowledges and agrees to the fullest extent such duties or liabilities are afforded by law or by equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated, and that we and any other Participant shall be held completely harmless in relation thereof. The User further agrees that the only duties and obligations that we or any Participant owes the User, and the only rights the User has related to this Agreement or the User’s use of the Interface or the Protocol, are those set out expressly in this Agreement.

**17. Provisions Specific to Certain Types of Participants.**

The Interface and the Protocol enable Participants to serve in certain capacities or perform certain functionalities when interacting with the Protocol. In order to serve in some of these capacities or otherwise perform these functionalities, the User may have been required to enter into other agreements or documents, each of which is hereby incorporated for reference. The types of Protocol capacities or functionalities available to Participants, and the provisions and restrictions applicable to Participates serving in such capacities or performing such functionalities, via the Interface include the following, and the User expressly agrees to be bound by any such applicable provisions and restrictions if it serves in any such capacity and/or performs any such functionality:

* If the User is an MPL Holder:

There exist certain risks or harms related to staking crypto-assets generally and staking Maple tokens (“MPL(s)”) specifically, including (without limitation) risks of harm related to lock-ups, vulnerabilities in underlying smart contracts, crypto-asset price volatility, private key compromise or loss, blockchain transaction fees, or user-errors in crypto-asset transmission. The User also represents its understanding that certain risks or harms exist related to governance, including the possibility of vote manipulation or voter collusion, lack of notice related to ongoing voting matters, fixed periods where a MPL holder may vote, the failure for MPL holders to collectively achieve consensus to vote or to reach a conclusion, and other similar governance-related risks. The User acknowledges the foregoing, represents its understanding of the foregoing, and agrees to assume full responsibility for all of the risks related to its status as an MPL Holder (including, without limitation, the User’s use of the Interface to perform certain MPL holder functionalities), whether mentioned in this paragraph or otherwise. The User acknowledges the risk of complete loss of MPL through staking or otherwise.

* If the User is a Lender:

There are risks to serving as a Lender. It is possible that the actions or omissions of Pool Delegates, Borrowers, or other Participants may harm the User’s position if it serves as a Lender, including the potential of complete loss of the User’s crypto-assets. Many loans made via the Interface are either undercollateralized or uncollateralized and as such, if a default occurs, the User may lose crypto-assets. Even in the case of fully-collateralized mining loans, if a default occurs, the User may lose crypto-assets in many cases due to the expenses associated with liquidation, the shift in price of the underlying collateral, or other factors. Further, the immediate availability of Lender withdrawals is subject to the amount of cash at a given time in a Liquidity Pool. There may be instances where there is insufficient cash to process withdrawals and the User-Lender must wait for Borrower repayment, interest payments, or additional deposits to withdraw its funds. Withdrawals are pro-rated based on pool liquidity at the time of the withdrawal window. The User acknowledges the foregoing, represents its understanding of the foregoing, and agrees to assume full responsibility for all of the risks related to its status as Lender (including, without limitation, the User’s use of the Interface to perform certain Lender functionalities), whether those risks are mentioned in this paragraph or otherwise. Further, and without limiting any other similar prohibition contained in this Agreement, the User agrees not to engage in any harmful or fraudulent activity related to its status as a Lender, or to engage in any behaviors related to its use of Lender functionalities that are illegal or prohibited by any applicable law or regulation. The User further agrees to (to the fullest extent permissible by law) to waive any liability, and to otherwise hold harmless, the Company, any Pool Delegate, MPL Holder, or any other Participant for any harms or damages not caused by that party’s gross negligence, recklessness, or intentional misconduct. The User re-acknowledges and reasserts its agreement that its use of the Interface does not create or impose any fiduciary duties between the User and the Company nor any other Participant.

In the case of a default, Users will be reimbursed in the following order, until funds are depleted: enforcement costs to Maple or Pool Delegate pursuant to the terms of the Maple legal agreements; principal balance owed to Lenders, on a pro-rata basis as of the date of default; accrued interest owed to Lenders, on a pro-rata basis as of the date of default; fees owed to Maple; pool cover owed to Pool Delegate and/or stakers; fees owed to Pool Delegate.

* If the User is a Borrower:

The User agrees to abide by the terms and provisions of the Maple legal agreements and any Loan Confirmation it executed in relation to the Protocol (each of which is hereby incorporated by reference). The User agrees not to use or access the Interface in any way that would violate those terms and provisions, including (without limitation) manipulating the Interface in any way that may allow it to borrow larger amounts or according to different terms from any liquidity pool than as agreed to in those documents.&#x20;

* If the User is a Pool Delegate:

The User agrees to abide by the terms and provisions of the Maple Pool Delegate Agreement it executed in relation to the Protocol (which is hereby incorporated by reference). The User agrees not to use or access the Interface in any way that would violate those terms and provisions, including (without limitation) manipulating the Interface in any way that may allow it to defraud or manipulate any other Participants or otherwise engage in illegal or deceitful conduct.&#x20;

**18. Compliance.**

The Interface may not be available, appropriate, or legal for use in some jurisdictions. By accessing or using the Interface, the User agrees that it is solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations under any jurisdiction applicable to the User. This includes responsibility for taxes—the User is solely responsible for any and all taxes or assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any government authority or regulator associated with the User’s use of the Interface.&#x20;

The User may not use the Interface if the User is a citizen, resident, or member of any jurisdiction or group that is subject to economic sanctions by the United States (including those listed in Section 7), or if the User’s use or access of the Interface would be illegal or otherwise violate any applicable law.&#x20;

**19. Links from the Interface.**

If the Interface may contain links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for convenience only. This includes links contained in advertisements, including banner advertisements and sponsored links. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources, and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from the User’s use of them. If the User decides to access any of the third-party websites linked to this Interface, the User does so entirely at its own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites.

**20. Pool specific Terms & Conditions.**

The User agrees that
* That the User is in full control of the Wallet Addresses provided in the Maple web interface.
* That all virtual currency deposits made by the User into Maple Pools will be transferred from Wallet Addresses that are fully controlled by the User.
* That the User undertakes not to transfer any portion of the ERC-20 Tokens representing their deposit (the ‘LP Tokens’) into the Maple Pools to any Wallet Address which it does not control in full.
* That the User is an Accredited Investor, as defined by Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
* That if the User is not a US person, that the User:
    * Understands and agrees that the offering of LP Tokens in the Maple Pools is being made in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act and, accordingly, the LP Tokens may not be offered, sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred to any US person (as defined by Rule 902(k) of Regulation S); 
    * and is not lending on behalf or for the benefit of any US persons.
* That if the User is a US person, that the User:
    * Understands and agrees that the offering of LP Tokens in the Maple Pools are being made in reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act and, accordingly, the LP Tokens may not be offered, sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred except as permitted under the Act, pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom.
    * That the User understands and agrees that the offering of LP Tokens in the Maple Pools are being made in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), which exempts the Pool from registration under the 1940 Act, provided that the Pool does not have more than one hundred (100) Accredited Investors participating.


**21. Indemnification.**

The User agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, licensors, agents, and service providers, and its respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims (including claims by any government agency or body), liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to: (1) the User’s violation of these Terms of Use; (2) the User’s use of the Interface, including, but not limited to, the User’s interactions with the Protocol, use of or reliance on the Interface's content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use; (3) the User’s use or reliance on of any information obtained from the Interface; or (4) any other party’s access and use of the Interface or Protocol with the User’s assistance or by using any device or account that the User owns or control.

**22. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.**

All matters relating to the Interface and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Florida or any other jurisdiction).

**23. Arbitration; Class Arbitration Waiver.**&#x20;

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with the User’s use of the Interface or the Protocol, or in connection with this Agreement, including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association under its Rules of Arbitration. The tribunal shall have the power to rule on any challenge to its own jurisdiction or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of the agreement to arbitrate. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and that these Terms of Use do not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. In the event the prohibition on class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of the arbitration agreement will remain in force.

**24. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver.**

Without limiting Section 22, any disputes related to User’s use of the Interface or the Protocol must be brought in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding. This provision applies to any court action, action in front of a mediator, or class arbitration. The Parties agree to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.

ALL USERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE USER AND COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. To opt-out of arbitration, within 30 days of your use of the Interface, you must notify us in writing of your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration provisions by providing your first and last name and clear statement of your intent to opt out.  The written intent to opt-out should be sent to [contact@maple.finance](mailto:contact@maple.finance).

**25. Injunctive Relief Waiver.**

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the User agrees that the User will not be permitted to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief of any kind, such as any court action that may prevent the development or operation of the Interface.

**26. Limitation on Time to File Claims.**

ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM THE USER MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR ITS USE OF THE INTERFACE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

**27. Waiver and Severability.**

No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.&#x20;

**28. Entire Agreement.**

The Terms of Use and any documented incorporated by reference herein constitute the sole and entire agreement between the User and the Company regarding the Interface and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Interface.&#x20;
