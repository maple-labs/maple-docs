SYRUP is the governance token of the Maple ecosystem, powering both Maple Institutional and Syrup.fi platforms. The token serves multiple key functions:

1. Governance Rights: SYRUP holders can participate in protocol governance by staking their tokens and voting on key decisions affecting the ecosystem's future.
2. Staking Mechanism: Token holders can stake SYRUP to receive stSYRUP, a representation of staked SYRUP that enables governance participation and reward accrual. stSYRUP is not a separate token but a mechanism within the SYRUP smart contract.

The token does not represent any ownership in any company or entity, nor does it confer any rights to dividends or profit-sharing. It is purely a utility and governance token within the Maple ecosystem.

## C.          PART I – INFORMATION ON RISKS <a href="#heading-h.1fob9te" id="heading-h.1fob9te"></a>

I.1       Offer-Related Risks

_A description of the risks associated with the offer to the public of crypto-assets or their admission to trading._

Market Volatility Risk: The value of SYRUP tokens may be subject to significant price fluctuations. Trading volumes and liquidity may vary significantly, affecting the ability to buy or sell tokens. External market conditions and sentiment may impact token value regardless of protocol performance

Distribution Risk: The initial token distribution and ongoing emission schedule may affect token value. Changes to the emission schedule through governance decisions could impact token economics. Token buybacks using protocol revenue are dependent on lending activity performance and governance decisions by tokenholder voting.&#x20;

Regulatory Risk: Changes in regulatory frameworks could affect the ability to trade or use SYRUP tokens. Future regulations may impact the operation of the protocol or token utility. Cross-border regulatory differences may affect global accessibility.

\


### C.1          I.2       Issuer-Related Risks <a href="#heading-h.2et92p0" id="heading-h.2et92p0"></a>

_A description of the risks associated with the issuer, if different from the offeror or person seeking admission to trading, having regard to risks related to the issuer's financial situation, risks related to the issuer's business activities and industry, legal and regulatory risk, internal control risk, environmental, social and governance risks._

Regulatory Compliance Risks: The structure might present potential regulatory scrutiny as global authorities increasingly focus on offshore crypto issuers. The upcoming implementation of MiCA requirements in the EU, combined with evolving regulations in other jurisdictions, may necessitate some compliance adaptations, possibly requiring resource-intensive structural modifications to the protocol's operations. Under MiCA, SYRUP is classified as a utility token; however, if staking rewards or buybacks are interpreted as profit-sharing, regulators could reclassify it, triggering additional compliance obligations. Maple DAO monitors regulatory developments to ensure ongoing compliance.

Operational Risks: The dual-product structure of Maple Institutional and Syrup.fi creates operational interdependencies that could affect protocol performance. The management of institutional loan origination requires specialized expertise that may be difficult to scale. The protocol's revenue generation depends on the efficient collection of loan service fees from borrowers, creating potential points of operational failure. Additionally, the decentralized governance model may introduce operational latency in responding to emergent market challenges or opportunities..

Financial Risks: The 5% annualized inflation schedule could create dilutive pressure if not matched by protocol growth. Revenue volatility from institutional lending fluctuations may impact the protocol's ability to sustain SYRUP buybacks. The protocol's financial stability is closely tied to institutional borrower repayment performance, creating concentration risk in revenue sources.

Legal Risks: While a legal opinion indicates SYRUP is not a capital markets product in Singapore, this determination may not extend to other jurisdictions. The smart contract-based governance system operates in a legally ambiguous environment regarding enforceability of on-chain decisions. The protocol's institutional lending activities may implicate various lending regulations across jurisdictions where borrowers operate.

Fraud and Mismanagement Risks: While the SYRUP token utilizes non-custodial, decentralized smart contracts for staking and governance, certain protocol operations retain centralized components that could be vulnerable to mismanagement. The management of protocol treasury funds represents a potential vector for fraud if governance controls are inadequate. The migration process from MPL to SYRUP tokens created a temporary point of centralized control during the transition. The revenue collection mechanisms require proper implementation to ensure all protocol fees are correctly accounted for and distributed.

Reputational Risks: As a facilitator of institutional lending, Maple Finance's reputation is crucial for attracting both lenders and borrowers. Any credit defaults or underperformance within the lending portfolio could significantly damage market confidence. Association with controversial borrowers might trigger negative market perception. The protocol's position bridging traditional finance and DeFi creates heightened reputational expectations regarding risk management and transparency.&#x20;

Technology Management Risks: The SYRUP token ecosystem relies on several sophisticated smart contracts, including the ERC-4626 Tokenized Vault Standard implementation. The ongoing maintenance and necessary upgrades to these technical components require consistent technical oversight. Should development resources become constrained or technical expertise diminish, critical updates may be delayed, potentially affecting protocol security or functionality.

Dependency on Key Individuals: The Maple Finance ecosystem's technical architecture and ongoing development may depend on the continued involvement of key technical personnel with specialized knowledge of the protocol's implementation. While the protocol governance is decentralized, the technical expertise needed for implementing governance decisions may be concentrated among a limited group of developers familiar with the codebase.

Conflicts of Interest: The governance system, wherein only stSYRUP holders can participate in protocol decision-making, creates potential scenarios where governance participants may prioritize token value appreciation through mechanisms like inflation adjustment over long-term protocol sustainability. This structure requires careful management to ensure governance decisions serve the protocol's long-term viability.

Counterparty Risks: The protocol's revenue stream depends on the ongoing repayment of loans by institutional borrowers. This exposes participants in the ecosystem to counterparty risk. While lending activities are secured according to the protocol's risk parameters, borrower defaults could affect protocol solvency and the ability to continue operations.

### C.2          I.3       Crypto-Assets-Related Risks <a href="#heading-h.tyjcwt" id="heading-h.tyjcwt"></a>

_A description of the risks associated with the crypto-assets._

Market Risk: The SYRUP token, despite its utility functions within the Maple Finance ecosystem, remains susceptible to significant price fluctuations common to digital assets. Market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and crypto market trends may cause substantial value variations independent of the token's fundamental utility or the protocol's performance.

As a governance token with multiple utility functions, SYRUP faces inherent challenges in market price discovery and valuation consensus. The token's worth derives from subjective assessments of governance rights, staking rewards, and protocol growth prospects, creating potential for divergent valuation models and price instability.

SYRUP may experience price movements correlated with broader cryptocurrency market trends, potentially undermining diversification benefits for holders. During periods of market-wide volatility, the token could experience price fluctuations irrespective of Maple's operational performance or fundamentals.

Liquidity Risk: SYRUP may experience periods of limited trading volume, potentially restricting holders' ability to execute large transactions without significant price impact. This could result in increased slippage and execution challenges, particularly during market stress periods.

The staking mechanism, while incentivizing token retention, may lead to substantial portions of the supply being locked, reducing circulating liquidity. Should large stakers suddenly unstake and liquidate positions, market order books may lack sufficient depth to absorb selling pressure.

SYRUP's trading on specific exchanges like Bitstamp Europe S.A. creates potential single points of failure for liquidity provision. Technical issues, regulatory actions, or policy changes affecting these trading venues could temporarily or permanently impair token liquidity.

Custodial Risk: SYRUP holders must independently secure their token access credentials, with any private key compromise potentially resulting in permanent, irrecoverable token loss. The absence of centralized recovery mechanisms places complete security responsibility on individual holders..

While designed as non-custodial, the staking mechanism relies on smart contract integrity. Technical vulnerabilities could potentially restrict access to staked tokens or create unexpected behavior in the stSYRUP relationship.

Token holders face potential technical complications with certain wallet implementations, possibly affecting token visibility, transaction execution, or interaction with staking functions. These compatibility challenges could impair effective token custody and utilization.

Smart Contract Risk: Despite implementing established standards like ERC-4626, the SYRUP token ecosystem remains vulnerable to potential undiscovered bugs or security weaknesses. Smart contract vulnerabilities could lead to token theft, unauthorized minting, or functionality impairment.

Future protocol upgrades necessitated by evolving requirements or security patches introduce execution risk. Implementation errors during upgrades could potentially disrupt token functionality, staking mechanisms, or governance systems.

The token's reliance on external systems for governance and various technical standards creates dependencies on third-party components outside direct protocol control. Vulnerabilities or changes in these dependencies could adversely affect token utility..

Regulatory and Tax Risk: Despite favorable legal opinions in certain jurisdictions like Singapore, the SYRUP token faces potential regulatory reclassification risks as global cryptocurrency regulations evolve. Future regulatory determinations could impose unexpected compliance requirements or operational restrictions.

Token holders face uncertain and potentially complex tax implications regarding staking rewards, governance participation, and token conversions. Tax authorities worldwide continue developing digital asset guidance, creating compliance uncertainty and potential retroactive liability.

The global accessibility of the SYRUP token creates multi-jurisdictional regulatory exposure. Activities permissible in one jurisdiction may violate regulations in others, creating complex compliance demands for both the protocol and token holders.

Counterparty Risk: The protocol's revenue stream depends on institutional borrowers' loan repayments. Borrower defaults could significantly impact protocol revenue, potentially reducing funds available for token buybacks and ecosystem growth.

SYRUP's utility relies partially on third-party integrations for governance execution, and technical infrastructure. Operational issues or business failures among these partners could temporarily or permanently impair certain token functionalities.

The protocol's ongoing development requires specialized expertise. Key personnel departures could potentially delay technical improvements, security responses, or ecosystem expansion, affecting token utility and value.

Reputational Risk: SYRUP’s utility is linked to Maple Finance's reputation in institutional lending markets. Protocol failures, security incidents, or governance controversies could significantly impact token market perception.

The protocol's institutional lending focus naturally attracts regulatory attention. Adverse regulatory findings or enforcement actions could substantially damage market confidence and institutional adoption, potentially affecting token utility and value.

Future major protocol modifications could create market uncertainty and temporary confidence disruptions affecting token stability.

### C.3          I.4       Project Implementation-Related Risks <a href="#heading-h.3dy6vkm" id="heading-h.3dy6vkm"></a>

### C.4          I.5       Technology-Related Risks <a href="#heading-h.1t3h5sf" id="heading-h.1t3h5sf"></a>

_A description of the risks associated with the technology used._

Private Key Management Risk and Loss of Access to Crypto-Assets: SYRUP token holders bear complete responsibility for securing their private keys and wallet credentials. Loss of private keys results in permanent, irreversible forfeiture of token access with no recovery mechanism available. Hardware failure, software corruption, and inadequate backup procedures can lead to complete asset loss. Phishing attacks and social engineering techniques specifically targeting cryptocurrency holders present ongoing security threats. Password-protected wallets risk permanent inaccessibility if credentials are forgotten. Multi-signature security implementations, while enhancing security, introduce additional points of potential access failure. Estate planning complexities create significant inheritance barriers, as tokens controlled by deceased individuals may become permanently inaccessible without proper succession arrangements.

Settlement and Transaction Finality:Ethereum-based transactions involving SYRUP tokens could be subject to network confirmation delays during periods of congestion, potentially extending transaction finalization times. Network fee fluctuations may leave transactions with insufficient gas unconfirmed for extended periods or rejected entirely. Blockchain reorganizations, though rare, could temporarily reverse seemingly confirmed transactions. Front-running and sandwich attacks by network validators or observers can manipulate transaction execution order to extract value from SYRUP token transactions, particularly during high-volume trading periods. Cross-chain implementations or bridged token versions would introduce settlement finality vulnerabilities related to relayer networks and external validation mechanisms.

Scaling Limitations and Transaction Fees: Ethereum network congestion could impact SYRUP token transaction costs and confirmation times, potentially rendering small transactions economically unfeasible during high-demand periods. Gas fee unpredictability creates transaction planning challenges, particularly for time-sensitive governance participation or staking operations. The Ethereum blockchain's throughput limitations could constrain protocol growth during periods of rapid adoption. Layer 2 scaling solutions, if implemented, would introduce additional technical complexity and potential interoperability challenges. Implementation of Ethereum protocol upgrades could temporarily disrupt token functionality or require wallet configuration adjustments. Complex contract interactions such as staking or governance participation consume substantially more gas than simple transfers, creating elevated cost barriers during network congestion.

Economic Self-sufficiency and Operational Parameters: The protocol's revenue model depends on sustainable institutional lending demand, which may fluctuate with market conditions independent of governance decisions. The token inflation schedule could create persistent selling pressure if not matched by proportional demand growth. The token buyback mechanism funded by protocol revenue establishes a circular dependency where diminished protocol activity directly impacts token value support. Governance parameters require ongoing optimization, with miscalibrated voting thresholds potentially leading to decision paralysis or insufficient stakeholder representation. The linear reward distribution model for staked tokens creates fixed economic parameters that may prove suboptimal in volatile market conditions. Token value is fundamentally linked to perceived governance utility, creating vulnerability to alternative governance mechanisms or competing protocols. Long-term protocol sustainability requires consistent development funding, creating tension between treasury conservation and necessary technical advancement.

Network Attacks and Cyber Security Risks: The SYRUP token ecosystem could theoretically face disruption from various cyber threats targeting the Ethereum network, including 51% attacks, Sybil attacks, and DDoS attacks. Such attacks could impair transaction processing, compromise consensus integrity, or temporarily disable platform accessibility. Targeted attacks against critical network infrastructure could disrupt SYRUP token transfers or governance activities during crucial voting periods, potentially affecting protocol-critical decisions..

Consensus Failures or Forks:Ethereum network forks could represent risks to SYRUP token operations, potentially creating duplicate token instances or conflicting transaction histories. Network consensus failures could temporarily freeze token transfers or smart contract interactions. During contentious forks, SYRUP holders may face uncertainty regarding which chain represents legitimate token ownership, potentially requiring complex technical interventions to secure assets across both chains..

Bugs in the Blockchain’s Core Code: SYRUP operates on Ethereum's extensively reviewed codebase rather than implementing novel blockchain architecture. The token functionality creates logical separation from underlying protocol code, limiting potential impact of core blockchain vulnerabilities. The transparent design enables continuous security assessment by ecosystem participants beyond issuer-initiated reviews.

Smart Contract Security Risk: Implementation of standardized ERC-4626 architecture leverages extensively audited code patterns with known security properties. The Revenue Distribution Token design builds upon established implementations rather than pioneering untested techniques. The non-custodial architecture limits potential impact of contract vulnerabilities by preserving user key control. The transparent GitHub repositories enable ongoing independent security review.

Dependency on Underlying Technology: The token's implementation on Ethereum benefits from the network's substantial infrastructure redundancy and geographic distribution. The institutional focus naturally incorporates enterprise-grade operational continuity considerations. The governance mechanism enables responsive adaptation to underlying infrastructure evolution without requiring token redesign.

Risk of Technological Disruption: SYRUP's modular smart contract architecture facilitates targeted upgrades addressing emerging technological developments without requiring wholesale redesign. The governance mechanism enables responsive adaptation to technological advancement through transparent decision-making. The ERC-4626 implementation follows contemporary standards positioning the protocol to evolve alongside Ethereum's roadmap. Institutional orientation naturally incorporates long-term technological planning exceeding typical retail-focused projects.

Governance Risk: The requirement that governance participants must stake SYRUP creates economic alignment with protocol health, discouraging decisions that damage long-term sustainability. The transparent Snapshot voting system prevents opaque governance manipulation. The 7-day voting window balances deliberative consideration with decision efficiency. The quorum requirements ensure decisions reflect substantial stakeholder consensus rather than narrow interests.

Anonymity and Privacy Risk: The protocol's institutional focus naturally aligns with appropriate transparency rather than excessive privacy that could facilitate illicit activity. The governance mechanism enables privacy parameter adjustment responding to evolving regulatory frameworks. The on-chain transaction transparency creates auditability appropriate for institutional financial operations. Implementation on Ethereum leverages the network's established privacy-preserving transaction patterns.

Data Corruption: Implementation on Ethereum's immutable ledger prevents retroactive data manipulation through distributed consensus validation. The transparent smart contract execution creates verifiable state transitions resistant to corruption. The non-custodial architecture preserves user control of assets independent of protocol data integrity. Multiple independent blockchain explorers enable cross-validation of critical transaction data.

Third-Party Risks: The non-custodial staking architecture eliminates dependencies on third-party asset custody. Direct smart contract interaction enables participation without intermediary service providers. The transparent protocol operation facilitates independent verification without reliance on third-party attestation. The token's ERC-20 compatibility ensures availability across multiple wallet implementations, preventing single-provider dependencies.

_A description of the functionality of the crypto-assets being offered or admitted to trading._

SYRUP is the governance token of the Maple Finance ecosystem, enabling holders to stake tokens to participate in protocol governance decisions. When staked, users receive stSYRUP which represents their proportional share of the staking pool and allows voting on proposals. SYRUP’s utility is enhanced by protocol revenue used for buybacks, which may be distributed to stakers as rewards, not as guaranteed returns. Its value depends on market perception and protocol adoption, not intrinsic profit rights.

General Information on Distributed Ledger Technology and Blockchain

SYRUP tokens operate on the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality. Ethereum uses distributed ledger technology where all transaction records are maintained across a network of computers (nodes) rather than by a central authority. This distributed approach enhances security, transparency, and immutability of data.

Key characteristics of the Ethereum blockchain include:

●     Distribution: Ethereum operates on a global network of nodes, each maintaining a copy of the entire ledger, participating in transaction verification and consensus.

●     Security: Ethereum employs advanced cryptographic methods to secure transactions and data, making the ledger resistant to tampering.

●     Smart Contracts: Unlike earlier blockchains, Ethereum introduced programmable smart contracts that automatically execute when predefined conditions are met.

●     Transparency and Immutability: All transactions on Ethereum are visible to network participants and once confirmed, become virtually immutable.

The Ethereum Blockchain

Ethereum is a public, permissionless blockchain launched in July 2015 that extends beyond simple value transfer to provide a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and programmable transactions. Ethereum currently uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism called Ethereum 2.0 (following "The Merge" upgrade in September 2022), which significantly reduced its energy consumption compared to its previous Proof-of-Work mechanism.

Ethereum's native cryptocurrency is Ether (ETH), which serves as the primary medium for transaction fees (gas) and interactions with the network. ETH is used to pay for computation and storage resources on the Ethereum network.

Ethereum's Smart Contract Capabilities

SYRUP tokens are implemented as ERC-20 standard tokens on Ethereum. The ERC-20 standard defines a common set of rules that all Ethereum tokens must follow, enabling interoperability between tokens and applications. Smart contracts on Ethereum are written primarily in Solidity, a Turing-complete programming language designed specifically for Ethereum.

The SYRUP staking mechanism is implemented through the ERC-4626 Tokenized Vault Standard, which provides a standardized way for representing tokenized vaults that hold ERC-20 tokens. This implementation allows for the secure staking of SYRUP tokens and the distribution of rewards to stakers.

&#x20;        Ethereum's Fee Structure

Transactions on Ethereum require gas fees paid in ETH. Gas is a measure of computational effort required to execute operations on the network. Gas fees fluctuate based on network congestion and are paid to validators who process transactions and secure the network.

### K.2          Protocols and Technical Standards <a href="#heading-h.3dhjn8m" id="heading-h.3dhjn8m"></a>

_Information about protocols and technical standards._

SYRUP tokens implement the following technical standards:

ERC-20: The standard interface for fungible tokens on Ethereum, allowing for seamless integration with wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi applications.

ERC-4626: The Tokenized Vault Standard used for the staking mechanism, providing a standardized interface for yield-bearing vaults.

Snapshot: For off-chain governance voting, reducing gas costs while maintaining transparency and security.

### K.3          Technology Used <a href="#heading-h.1smtxgf" id="heading-h.1smtxgf"></a>

_Other information on the technology used allowing for the holding, storing and transfer of crypto-assets, if relevant._

SYRUP tokens can be stored in any ERC-20 compatible wallet, including:

●     Self-custodial wallets: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger, Trezor

●     Smart contract wallets: Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe), Argent

●     Mobile wallets: Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet

For governance participation, users connect their wallet to Snapshot's interface through a Web3 browser connection. The staking interface on syrup.fi is accessible through standard Web3 browser extensions.

### K.4          Consensus Mechanism <a href="#heading-h.4cmhg48" id="heading-h.4cmhg48"></a>

_Information on the consensus mechanism, where applicable._

SYRUP tokens operate on Ethereum, which uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. In this system, validators are selected to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of ETH they have staked as collateral. This approach is significantly more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work systems.

The Ethereum PoS mechanism includes slashing conditions to penalize malicious validators, providing economic security to the network. Transaction finality is typically achieved within minutes, allowing for secure and relatively fast transaction settlement.

&#x20;

### K.5          Incentive Mechanisms and Applicable Fees <a href="#heading-h.2rrrqc1" id="heading-h.2rrrqc1"></a>

_Information on incentive mechanisms to secure transactions and any fees applicable._

SYRUP's economic model includes two primary incentive mechanisms:

1. Protocol Revenue Distribution: Management and service fees collected from institutional loans facilitated by Maple may be used to buy back SYRUP tokens from the market. These tokens are distributed to stakers as rewards for participating in protocol governance.
2. Inflation-Based Rewards: A 5% annual inflation rate for the first three years (beginning November 2023) generates new SYRUP tokens that are distributed to stakers, incentivizing long-term participation in protocol governance.

Applicable fees for SYRUP transactions include standard Ethereum network gas fees, which vary based on network congestion. The staking smart contract is designed to minimize gas costs while ensuring security and proper reward distribution.

&#x20;

### K.6          Use of Distributed Ledger Technology <a href="#heading-h.16x20ju" id="heading-h.16x20ju"></a>

_Indication as to whether the crypto-assets are issued, transferred and stored using distributed ledger technology that is operated by the issuer, the offeror or a third-party acting on their behalf._

\[Free alphanumerical text; generally only needed if H.1 above is true]

The Ethereum network is operated by a decentralized network of validators worldwide, not by Maple DAO or any single entity. The SYRUP token and its associated smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain but do not control the underlying infrastructure.

### K.8          Audit <a href="#heading-h.261ztfg" id="heading-h.261ztfg"></a>

_Indication as to whether an audit of the technology used was conducted._

true

### K.9          Audit Outcome <a href="#heading-h.l7a3n9" id="heading-h.l7a3n9"></a>

_If an audit was conducted, information on the outcome of the audit of the technology used._

The SYRUP token smart contracts have undergone comprehensive security audits by specialized blockchain security firms. These audits examined the implementation of the ERC-20 token standard, the staking mechanism based on ERC-4626, and the reward distribution functionality.

The audits verified that the smart contracts correctly implement their intended functionality and are free from critical vulnerabilities. Specific attention was paid to potential issues like reentrancy attacks, integer overflow/underflow, and front-running vulnerabilities. Minor issues identified during the audit process were addressed before the final deployment of the contracts.

The token migration contract that facilitated the conversion from MPL to SYRUP at a 1:100 ratio was also audited to ensure the accurate and secure conversion of tokens. The full audit reports are publicly accessible on the Maple Finance GitHub repository.
