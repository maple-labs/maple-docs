### Admin Controls

The Maple DAO has administrative controls over certain aspects of the protocol that are utilised by Syrup.

### Smart Contract Risk

Smart contracts increase their risk profile with the amount of value they hold. The Maple team takes this threat very seriously and has audited the protocol code both internally and externally. The most recent version of the smart contracts has been audited by [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/), [Three Sigma](https://threesigma.xyz/labs/code-audits) and [0xMacro](https://0xmacro.com/). More information can be found in the [Security](https://maplefinance.gitbook.io/maple/technical-resources/security) section of the Maple documentation.&#x20;

### Default Risk

Syrup provides access to loans originated to institutional counterparties. These loans are governed by Master Lending Agreements and collateral is posted to secure each of them. However, each loan is subject to the risk of default and could lead to potential losses for Lenders.

### Risk of Loss

Holding, lending, or borrowing digital assets involves a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of complete loss of those assets.
