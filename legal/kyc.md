# KYC

Maple performs Know-Your-Customer checks on all Lenders and Borrowers across the platform. These checks include:

i) The collection of documentation and information to identify the user. In case of an Entity, the Ultimate Beneficial Owners and Directors are identified as well.

ii) Accreditation checks on Lenders.

iii) PEP and Sanction scans for all users.

iv) As a condition precedent to deposit, all lender wallets are scanned for risk factors using TRM Labs. Lender wallets that hit on risks (including interaction with high risk counterparty wallets) are blocked.

Once onboarded, this gives users access to all the different pools on the Maple platform.
