# 4. Representations and Warranties of the Tokenholder:

By participating in the MPL Token Migration, the Tokenholder hereby represents and warrants to Maple DAO (BVI) Ltd. as follows:

**4.1 No Sanctions**: The Tokenholder is not (and, if an entity, is not owned or controlled by any other person who is), acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf of any other person who is: in contravention of any applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering regulations or conventions; a terrorist or a member of a terrorist organisation; identified on, or operationally based or domiciled in a country or territory that is included in, any list of prohibited parties under any law or by any nation or government, state or other political subdivision thereof, any entity exercising legislative, judicial or administrative functions of or pertaining to government such as the sanctions lists maintained by the United Kingdom (as are extended to the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands by statutory instrument), United Nations (whether through the Security Council, or otherwise), the U.S. government (including the U.S. Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals list and Foreign Sanctions Evaders list), or the European Union (EU) or its member states; a senior foreign political figure, any member of a senior foreign political figure’s immediate family or any close associate of a senior foreign political figure; or as trustee, agent, representative or nominee for a foreign shell bank. The MPLv1 Tokens you hold are not derived from, and do not otherwise represent the proceeds of, any activities done in violation or contravention of any law.

**4.2 Tax Advice**: The Tokenholder has taken their own tax advice in connection with the Token Migration and will bear full responsibility for any tax consequences arising from their participation in the Token Migration.

**4.3 Capacity**: If the Tokenholder is an individual, they are of legal age in the jurisdiction in which they reside (and in any event are older than eighteen years of age) and are of sound mind. If the Tokenholder is an entity, it is duly organised, incorporated or registered, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organised, incorporated or registered, and has all requisite power and authority for a business entity of its type to carry on its business as now conducted.

**4.6 No Expectation of Profit**: The Tokenholder represents and warrants that they are not participating in the Token Migration with the expectation of realising a profit. Furthermore, the Tokenholder acknowledges and agrees that they have not relied on any actual or implied representations or promises by Maple regarding the potential for profit, appreciation, or any other form of financial return associated with the MPLv2 Tokens.

# 5. Migration Process

5.1 The migration involves a one-to-one migration of MPLv1 Tokens to MPLv2 Tokens. For every MPLv1 Token submitted to the smart contract, the Tokenholder will receive one MPLv2 Token in return.

5.2 An xMPL holder does not need to take action. All of the MPLv1 Tokens in the xMPL contract will be sent to the migration contract and converted 1-1 to MPLv2 Tokens. When any xMPL holder goes to withdraw from the xMPL contract they will receive MPLv2 Tokens.

5.3 The Tokenholder acknowledges and understands that participation in the Token Migration is entirely voluntary and that the process is irreversible.

5.4 To participate in the Token Migration, you need to:
* Go to app.maple.finance/#/mpl
* Connect your wallet to the webapp
* Enter the amount of MPLv1 Tokens you want to migrate
* Click the “migration” button

5.5 The smart contract will then migrate your MPLv1 Tokens for MPLv2 Tokens. The MPLv2 tokens will be deposited into your wallet.

5.6 Maple has deployed a smart contract as the only method for exchanging MPLv1 Tokens for MPLv2 Tokens during the Migration Period. Access to this migration system will be available through the Website. To the extent that any other third party website, service, or smart contract offers MPLv2 Tokens during the Migration Period or facilitates the sale, exchange, or transfer of MPLv2 Tokens in any way during the Migration Period or at any time up to the release of the MPLv2 Tokens, such third party websites or services are, unless explicitly stated otherwise on the Website, not authorised by Maple and have no relationship in any way with Maple or any of our affiliates, and such MPLv2 Tokens shall be invalid.

5.7 These Terms do not constitute a prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment or any kind, and does not pertain in any way to an initial public offering or a share/equity offering, and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. The Terms are a description of the Token Migration process and the terms governing the Token Migration.

# 6. Risks and Disclaimers

There are certain risks associated with participating in the Token Migration, including:

6.1 The migration is conducted solely through the smart contract mechanism. Maple does not take responsibility for any technical issues, including but not limited to network congestion, wallet compatibility, or transaction failures, that may affect the migration process or loss of MPLv1 Tokens or MPLv2 Tokens.

6.2 The wallet you use to connect to the Website and participate in the Token Migration is not under the control or influence of Maple, who will not be able to restore or reverse any transactions in respect of property lost or frozen due to loss of private keys or otherwise. If you are not able to participate in the Token Migration or use the MPLv1 Tokens or MPLv2 Tokens due to loss or theft of the corresponding private key or otherwise, you will be unable to enjoy the benefits of the MPLv1 or MPLv2 Tokens.

6.3 Experimental cryptographic technologies and blockchain technologies, including tokens, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, “smart contracts,” consensus algorithms, voting systems and distributed, decentralised or peer-to-peer networks or systems in connection with the Website, the MPLv1 Token, the MPLv2 Token and the Token Migration are novel, experimental, and speculative, and that therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding the operation and effects and risks thereof and the application of existing law thereto.

6.4 The Token Migration is being conducted on an "as is" basis, and there is no guarantee that the migration will be successful. You should carefully consider the risks involved before participating in the Token Migration.

6.5 You understand and agree that the migration process is irreversible, and you will not be able to recover the MPLv1 Tokens once they have been submitted.

6.6 All information provided by or on behalf of Maple is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional, accounting or legal advice. You should not take or refrain from taking any action in reliance on any information contained in these terms or provided by or on behalf of Maple in connection with the Token Migration. Before you make any financial, legal, or other decisions involving the Website or the Token Migration, you should seek independent professional advice from persons licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.

6.7 The Token Migration and the MPLv2 Token could be adversely impacted by one or more regulatory or legal inquiries, actions, suits, investigations, claims, fines or judgments, which could impede or limit your ability to participate in the Token Migration or continue use of the MPLv2 Token.
