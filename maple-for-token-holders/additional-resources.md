**Legal and Compliance**

Solely SYRUP stakers are eligible to participate in governance. The staker retains ownership of their tokens for the duration of the staking period and remains free to un-stake and withdraw their SYRUP tokens at any time.

All staked SYRUP tokens are not deployed to any commercial purpose while staked, they remain idle in the smart contract and serve to secure the network.

The staking smart contract is a decentralized part of the protocol and is non-custodial. There is no third party service provider that takes possession of the staked tokens, nor does any third party play a role in actively managing or controlling the staked SYRUP tokens. No party holds the private keys for the staking contract; it is decentralized.

Staking SYRUP does not carry a contractual, or promised return to SYRUP stakers. The protocol is under no obligation to provide rewards or to distribute funds to SYRUP stakers, directly or indirectly, in any form. Any future decision to distribute rewards for staking or participating in governance would be dependent on, and subject to, the vote of SYRUP token holders.
