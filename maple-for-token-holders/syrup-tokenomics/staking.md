# Staking

**Staking rewards were sunset with MIP-019.** \
**Both SYRUP and stSYRUP holders will be able to vote on future proposals. 25% of ongoing protocol revenue will be allocated to the Syrup Strategic Fund (SSF) for SYRUP buybacks and building a robust DAO balance sheet.** [**Read more.**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:maple.eth/proposal/0x8151eb49b56770b882e8d9b6affd4a698572fc6eec31001c74bd977f61c84374)

#### **Unstaking** <a href="#staking-and-unstaking" id="staking-and-unstaking"></a>

After the MIP-19's approval the staking interface only supports unstaking. The smart contract is decentralized and non-custodial, meaning no third party takes possession of, actively manages, or controls staked tokens. Further, no party holds the private keys for the staking contract.

stSYRUP can be unstaked at any time without any limits or penalties. Staking is not tied to governance as both stSYRUP and SYRUP holders are able to participate in governance votes.

When unstaking, users keep all staking rewards earned and can instantly withdraw their SYRUP, with no lock-up period. See more technical details [here](https://syrup.gitbook.io/syrup/syrup-token/staking-smart-contract-details).
