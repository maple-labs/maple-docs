# MPL to SYRUP Conversion

### MPL to SYRUP Conversion Program: Now Concluded

### Background <a href="#background" id="background"></a>

In 2023, the Maple Community approved **MIP-009**, introducing the SYRUP token as the next evolution of governance and utility within the Maple ecosystem. SYRUP follows the inflation schedule and governance rules set in the proposal, with the total supply expected to reach **1,228,740,800** by 2026.

Following that, the community passed **MIP-010** in September 2024, enabling a one-time conversion of **1 MPL to 100 SYRUP** tokens. This transition unified the ecosystem under a single token and enhanced SYRUPâ€™s utility, including staking and governance rights. The conversion was designed to avoid dilution for MPL holders.

#### Conversion Program Concluded on April 30, 2025

The MPL to SYRUP conversion program **officially ended on April 30, 2025** as established by **MIP-011**.

* **Converting MPL or xMPL to SYRUP is discontinued.**
* **SYRUP and stSYRUP are now the only governance tokens in the Maple ecosystem.**
* MPL and xMPL no longer carry governance rights, staking benefits, or utility within the protocol.

#### What This Means for Holders

If you still hold MPL or xMPL tokens, please be aware that **they are no longer supported** for conversion or participation in the Maple protocol. All value and utility have transitioned exclusively to SYRUP.
