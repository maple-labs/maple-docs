#### What are the SYRUP token addresses? <a href="#what-are-the-syrup-token-addresses" id="what-are-the-syrup-token-addresses"></a>

* The addresses for SYRUP and Staked SYRUP are below:
  * SYRUP: [0x643C4E15d7d62Ad0aBeC4a9BD4b001aA3Ef52d66](https://etherscan.io/address/0x643C4E15d7d62Ad0aBeC4a9BD4b001aA3Ef52d66)
  * stSYRUP: [0xc7E8b36E0766D9B04c93De68A9D47dD11f260B45](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc7E8b36E0766D9B04c93De68A9D47dD11f260B45)

#### How do I see my SYRUP in my wallet? <a href="#how-do-i-see-my-syrup-in-my-wallet" id="how-do-i-see-my-syrup-in-my-wallet"></a>

* If you have converted to SYRUP or stSYRUP and your tokens are not immediately visible in your wallet, you may need to import the tokens as a supported asset. You can do so by adding a custom asset in your wallet and inputting the SYRUP or stSYRUP contract address (shown above).

#### Can I still convert MPL to SYRUP?

**No. The MPL to SYRUP conversion program officially ended on April 30, 2025**, as governed by **MIP-011**. MPL and xMPL can no longer be exchanged for SYRUP.

#### Can I still use MPL?

MPL and xMPL are no longer supported in the Maple ecosystem:

* **They no longer hold any governance rights or staking utility.**
* **They do not accrue protocol value.**
* **SYRUP and stSYRUP are now the only governance tokens used across the Maple ecosystem.**

MPL is expected to be phased out from all major exchange listings and protocol integrations in lieu of SYRUP.

#### I didn’t convert in time — what should I do?

Unfortunately, if you still hold MPL or xMPL, it is no longer possible to participate in the Maple ecosystem using those tokens. The value and governance rights have fully transitioned to SYRUP. Token holders may refer to official channels for future updates but should assume **conversion is permanently closed**.

## SYRUP Staking and Drips

#### **Is staking available in the US and Australia?**

Yes. **SYRUP staking is available globally**, including to users in the United States and Australia. However, **earning yield from institutional lending remains restricted in select jurisdictions** due to regulatory compliance. SYRUP staking and governance participation are unaffected by these restrictions.

#### **What is the APY for SYRUP staking?**

Staking rewards are determined by protocol parameters and vary based on the percentage of SYRUP staked. During the initial 90-day launch period, **5,000,000 SYRUP** were distributed linearly. For example, if **25% of the circulating supply is staked**, the estimated APY would be around **9%**.

There is no guaranteed return, and **future distributions are subject to governance votes**.

#### **How is the value of Drips calculated?**

At the end of each Season, the conversion of Drips to SYRUP is announced. Lifetime Drips rewards reflect the amount of Drips earned for the duration of a user’s participation, with the conversion from Drips to SYRUP locked in at the end of each season.

Users will be able to begin claiming their [Drips rewards](https://syrup.gitbook.io/syrup/syrup-token/drips-rewards) through the Syrup webapp starting 15 December. Drips will be convertible to SYRUP in phases, starting with Season 1, with subsequent Seasons’ Drips made available in subsequent months.
