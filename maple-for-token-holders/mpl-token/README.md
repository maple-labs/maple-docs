# Introduction to SYRUP

## What is SYRUP?

#### **Maple Ecosystem: Unified by SYRUP Token**

At the core of Maple is the **SYRUP token**, which aligns stakeholders, drives governance, and incentivizes participation. SYRUP is the governance token of the Maple ecosystem and powers two complementary but distinct product lines:

1. **Maple Permissioned (Institutional)**: Connecting institutional capital to high-quality digital asset lending opportunities.
2. **Maple Open Access:** A permissionless DeFi protocol democratizing access to institutional-grade yield.

SYRUP empowers participants to shape Maple’s future while directly benefiting from its success. It captures value, incentivizes participation, and ensures that growth is shared across the entire ecosystem.&#x20;

By staking SYRUP, participants can actively contribute to decision-making through governance while earning rewards, creating a dynamic and engaged community. This virtuous cycle of growth strengthens alignment, accelerates progress, and scales Maple’s influence.

Together, Maple Institutional and Syrup.fi create a unified financial product offering that bridges the gap between institutional-grade lending and decentralized access.
