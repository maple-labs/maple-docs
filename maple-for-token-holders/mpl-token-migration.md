# Background:
* MIP009 was voted into place by the community on 12th September 2023.
* MIP009 approved the issuance of new tokens to the Maple Treasury via a one-time mint and a three-year emission. In order to do so the MPL token needs upgrading to MPLv2. [Read More](https://snapshot.org/#/maple.eth/proposal/0x29fccc3bac63744a55f9671399c079594e6b8369a21502cbce52e7dce9301094).

**Summary**:
The technical migration will complete on the 25th of September 2023, and from the 25th of September holders will be able to convert MPLv1 to MPLv2.
The terms MPLv1 and MPLv2 are used only for purposes of explaining the migration. The name of the token will continue to be MPL.
Maple is coordinating the transition of MPLv1 to MPLv2 in a few ways.
* So holders can convert their tokens easily a conversion page will be made available at [app.maple.finance/#/mpl](app.maple.finance/#/mpl). This will be the only destination for conversion.
* Maple will automatically convert all MPLv1 held in the xMPL contract to MPLv2. This will complete on the 25th September.
* Maple is making arrangements with major exchanges so that MPLv1 tokens on the exchange will automatically be converted into MPLv2, with no action required from holders. We will share details relevant to each exchange ahead of the 25th September.
Conversion will be possible for 3 years, but encouraged as soon as possible so holders can access the value and utility of MPL.

# How to Guide
_In this guide the existing version of MPL (legacy MPL) will be referred to as MPLv1 and the updated version of MPL as MPLv2. xMPL will be referred to as xMPL._

This guide walks through how all MPL and xMPL holders can convert MPLv1 to MPLv2. 

# Converting MPLv1 to MPLv2

# FAQs
**Why should I migrate my MPL tokens?**
Within 3 years all MPLv1 will be converted to MPLv2. To take part in Maple governance and all future utility holders must upgrade to MPLv2. MPLv1 will be delisted on exchanges and replaced with MPLv2 trading pairs.

**Is it safe to convert MPLv1 to MPLv2?** 
Maple has taken every step to ensure that it is safe to convert MPLv1 to MPLv2 at a smart contract level. Firstly, the MPLv2 contract has been audited by Spearbit via Cantina and 3Sigma. The auditors assessed the MPLv2 smart contracts and the migration process. Secondly, the new token contract has undergone formal verification, the highest standard in smart contract security, which determines that the logic and desired behavior of the smart contract is satisfactory. The audit reports are available for review here: [https://github.com/maple-labs/mplv2/tree/main/audits](https://github.com/maple-labs/mplv2/tree/main/audits).
