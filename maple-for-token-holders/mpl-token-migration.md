# MPL to SYRUP Conversion

## Converting MPL to SYRUP: A Guide for MPL Holders

### Background <a href="#background" id="background"></a>

In 2023, the Maple Community approved MIP-009, and the SYRUP token will adhere to all of the governance and tokenomics that was agreed in that proposal. When factoring in the conversion and the agreed token inflation schedule and issuance, the total supply of SYRUP tokens will be 1,228,740,800 in 2026. All issuance from the initial schedule will also be minted as SYRUP tokens. Details on the token inflation schedule and issuance can be found in[ MIP-009](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-009-upgrade-mpl-token-design/300).&#x20;

Details on the conversion can be found in[ MIP-010](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-010-syrup-token-launch-and-mpl-syrup-conversion/334), which was voted into place by the community in September 2024. Following the approval of [MIP-010](https://maple.finance/news/syrup-token-launch-staking-and-conversion-of-mpl-to-syrup), existing MPL holders will be able to convert 1 MPL into 100 SYRUP tokens. This process will unify the broader Maple ecosystem, align long-term interests, and increase token utility - including SYRUP staking. During the conversion, there is no dilution for pre-existing MPL token holders.

Maple is coordinating the transition of MPL to SYRUP in a few ways.

MPL and xMPL holders can convert their tokens easily via a conversion page which will be made available at syrup.fi/convert. This will be the only destination for conversion.

Maple is making arrangements with major exchanges so that MPL tokens on the exchange will automatically be converted into SYRUP, with no action required from holders.

Conversion will be possible until the 30th of April 2025 (following [the approval of MIP-011](https://snapshot.box/#/s:maple.eth/proposal/0xa40eddf52876e5239d9ffcb2fa861d04c4fce146c050aa3580da72d21bcbc13e)), but encouraged as soon as possible so holders can access the value and utility of SYRUP.

#### Why should I convert my MPL tokens? <a href="#why-should-i-convert-my-mpl-tokens" id="why-should-i-convert-my-mpl-tokens"></a>

Converting your MPL to SYRUP allows you to earn staking rewards and vote in Maple and Syrup ecosystem governance. MPL will be delisted on exchanges and replaced with SYRUP trading pairs.

**What is the deadline for converting MPL to SYRUP?**

The latest date to convert MPL or xMPL into SYRUP is April 30th 2025. This has been proposed in [MIP-011](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-011-mpl-conversion-to-end-30th-of-april-2025/347/4) and approved through governance vote.&#x20;

#### What if my MPL is on an exchange? <a href="#what-if-my-mpl-is-on-an-exchange" id="what-if-my-mpl-is-on-an-exchange"></a>

Maple is in liaison with centralized exchanges to ensure smooth transition to SYRUP and will advise on the specific processes for different venues closer to the time. The aim is that MPL tokens on exchanges will automatically be converted into SYRUP requiring no action from holders.

#### What if I hold MPL and xMPL? <a href="#what-if-i-hold-mpl-and-xmpl" id="what-if-i-hold-mpl-and-xmpl"></a>

You will be able to migrate both your MPL and xMPL to SYRUP via the Convert page. You will be asked to convert your MPL first, and then can convert your xMPL afterward in a separate transaction.

#### How do I see my SYRUP in my wallet? <a href="#how-do-i-see-my-syrup-in-my-wallet" id="how-do-i-see-my-syrup-in-my-wallet"></a>

If you have converted to SYRUP or stSYRUP and your tokens are not immediately visible in your wallet, you may need to import the tokens as a supported asset. You can do so by adding a custom asset in your wallet and inputting the SYRUP or stSYRUP contract address (shown above).
