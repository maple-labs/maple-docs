# MPL Migration

## Converting MPL to SYRUP: A Guide for MPL Holders

## Background:

* To fuel the next wave of growth for Maple is initiating the launch of SYRUP token, the conversion of MPL to SYRUP, and the introduction of SYRUP staking. This latest proposal follows on from MIP-009, which recapitalised the Maple Treasury and helped the protocol launch key growth initiatives.[Read More](https://snapshot.org/#/maple.eth/proposal/0x6f2a2a4fb2e80bfc2f134cd79a0ebb2a0a6c2e2d11e6a5a49db2fc7b4588a5ec).&#x20;

**Summary**:

* As part of this launch, 1 MPL will convert to 100 SYRUP, with no dilution for existing MPL token holders.&#x20;
* Maple is making arrangements with major exchanges so that MPL tokens on the exchange will automatically be converted into SYRUP with no action required from holders. We will share details relevant to each exchange ahead of the migration.
* Conversion from MPL to SYRUP is encouraged, and will enable SYRUP token holders to support the SYRUP ecosystem and accumulate more tokens through staking.

The launch of [Syrup.fi](http://syrup.fi/) has given the Maple community permissionless access to its core institutional lending product through DeFi. In order to share the growth of Maple and [Syrup.fi](http://syrup.fi/) with the community, Core Contributors have proposed the implementation of staking rewards, and it has been approved by the Maple DAO.&#x20;

Fee revenues generated from Maple’s and Syrup’s lending operations will be used to buy back the SYRUP token, which will form part of the token emissions that go to stakers. In the first 90 days after token launch, a fixed amount of SYRUP emissions will go to SYRUP stakers, ensuring that all early stakers are incentivised with a staking yield for participating actively in the growth of the protocol.

As part of the implementation, the Syrup protocol will mint approximately 1.15 billion SYRUP.

Annualised recapitalisation would follow the same schedule as passed in [MIP-009](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-009-upgrade-mpl-token-design/300); all issuance from the initial schedule will also be minted as SYRUP tokens, broken down as follows:

1. 1,000,000,000 (new SYRUP supply)
2. 100,000,000 (initial 10% from inflation schedule)
3. 54,930,000 (from inflation schedule till 1st Oct 2024)

A migrator contract will be deployed to allow MPL users to convert to SYRUP, and all issuance and emissions related to [MIP-009](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-009-upgrade-mpl-token-design/300) will also be minted as SYRUP tokens.

For token holders, the migration is simple:

* MPL holders enter the Syrup webapp and connect their wallet
* Token holders can convert directly to staked SYRUP (stSYRUP)
* stSYRUP holders immediately begin receiving staking yield

### Converting MPL to SYRUP

All MPL is eligible to convert to SYRUP in Q4 after SYRUP token launch. This includes all MPL held in wallets decentralized exchanges, smart contracts (except xMPL), and centralized exchanges not covered in the summary.

More details around the conversion will be released in the weeks leading up to SYRUP token launch.&#x20;

## FAQs

**Why should I migrate my MPL tokens?**

To take part in Maple governance and accumulate SYRUP tokens through staking.&#x20;

**Is it safe to convert MPL to SYRUP?**

Maple has taken every step to ensure that it is safe to convert MPL to SYRUP at a smart contract level. Firstly, the SYRUP contract has been audited by Spearbit via Cantina and 3Sigma. The auditors assessed the SYRUP smart contracts and the migration process. Secondly, the new token contract has undergone formal verification, the highest standard in smart contract security, which determines that the logic and desired behaviour of the smart contract is satisfactory. The audit reports are available for review here: [https://github.com/maple-labs/mplv2/tree/main/audits](https://github.com/maple-labs/mplv2/tree/main/audits).

**What if my MPL is on an exchange?**

Maple is in liaison with centralized exchanges to ensure smooth transition to SYRUP and will advise on the specific processes for different venues closer to the time. The aim is that MPL tokens on exchanges will automatically be converted into SYRUP requiring no action from holders.

**What if I hold MPL and xMPL?**

xMPL will be migrated automatically to staked SYRUP (stSYRUP), no action is required there. For MPL, follow the steps outlined in the 'How to guide'.

**How do I vote with SYRUP after the conversion?**

The same voting process applies for SYRUP as for MPL.
