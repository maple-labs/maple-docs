# MPL to SYRUP Conversion

## Converting MPL to SYRUP: A Guide for MPL Holders

### Background <a href="#background" id="background"></a>

[MIP-010](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-010-syrup-token-launch-and-mpl-syrup-conversion/334) was voted into place by the community in September 2024.

Maple is coordinating the transition of MPL to SYRUP in a few ways.

MPL and xMPL holders can convert their tokens easily via a conversion page which will be made available at syrup.fi/convert. This will be the only destination for conversion.

Maple is making arrangements with major exchanges so that MPL tokens on the exchange will automatically be converted into SYRUP, with no action required from holders.

Conversion will be possible for 3 years, but encouraged as soon as possible so holders can access the value and utility of SYRUP.

Converting your MPL to SYRUP allows you to earn staking rewards and vote in Maple and Syrup ecosystem governance. MPL will be delisted on exchanges and replaced with SYRUP trading pairs.

**What is the deadline for converting MPL to SYRUP?**

The latest date to convert MPL or xMPL into SYRUP is April 30th 2025. This has been proposed in [MIP-011](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-011-mpl-conversion-to-end-30th-of-april-2025/347/4) and approved through governance vote.&#x20;

#### What if my MPL is on an exchange? <a href="#what-if-my-mpl-is-on-an-exchange" id="what-if-my-mpl-is-on-an-exchange"></a>

Maple is in liaison with centralized exchanges to ensure smooth transition to SYRUP and will advise on the specific processes for different venues closer to the time. The aim is that MPL tokens on exchanges will automatically be converted into SYRUP requiring no action from holders.

#### What if I hold MPL and xMPL? <a href="#what-if-i-hold-mpl-and-xmpl" id="what-if-i-hold-mpl-and-xmpl"></a>

You will be able to migrate both your MPL and xMPL to SYRUP via the Convert page. You will be asked to convert your MPL first, and then can convert your xMPL afterward in a separate transaction.

#### How do I see my SYRUP in my wallet? <a href="#how-do-i-see-my-syrup-in-my-wallet" id="how-do-i-see-my-syrup-in-my-wallet"></a>

If you have converted to SYRUP or stSYRUP and your tokens are not immediately visible in your wallet, you may need to import the tokens as a supported asset. You can do so by adding a custom asset in your wallet and inputting the SYRUP or stSYRUP contract address (shown above).
