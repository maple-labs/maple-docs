# Introduction to SYRUP

## What is SYRUP?

#### SYRUP Token <a href="#syrup-token" id="syrup-token"></a>

In conjunction with the launch of the Syrup protocol, the SYRUP token is launched in Q4 2024. SYRUP can be staked into stSYRUP to govern the broader Maple ecosystem, and users can contribute to the Protocol and earn more SYRUP.

**MPL to SYRUP Conversion**

Following the approval of [MIP-010](https://maple.finance/news/syrup-token-launch-staking-and-conversion-of-mpl-to-syrup), existing MPL holders will be able to convert 1 MPL into 100 SYRUP tokens. This process will unify the broader Maple ecosystem, align long-term interests, and increase token utility - including SYRUP staking. During the conversion, there is no dilution for existing MPL token holders.

In 2023, the Maple Community approved MIP-009, and the SYRUP token will adhere to all of the governance and tokenomics that was agreed in that proposal. When factoring in the conversion and the agreed token inflation schedule and issuance, the total supply of SYRUP tokens will be 1,228,740,800 in 2026. All issuance from the initial schedule will also be minted as SYRUP tokens. Details on the token inflation schedule and issuance can be found in[ MIP-009](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-009-upgrade-mpl-token-design/300). Details on the conversion can be found in[ MIP-010](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-010-syrup-token-launch-and-mpl-syrup-conversion/334).
