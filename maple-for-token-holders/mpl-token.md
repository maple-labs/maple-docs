# MPL

## What is MPL?

MPL is the governance token of the Maple Protocol. It enables holders to participate in governance and earn fees. MPL inherits the ERC-20 token standard for standard token behavior and the ERC-2222 token standard for profit distribution of USDC from the Maple Treasury. The Maple Treasury earns a portion of the fees generated by the Maple protocol.&#x20;

On a periodic basis, MPL holders will be able to vote on the use of the fees earned by the Treasury. The main options available are:

1. Buyback MPL to be held in treasury
2. Distribute fees to Maple DAO to continue funding operations and growth
3. Distribute fees to MPL holders
