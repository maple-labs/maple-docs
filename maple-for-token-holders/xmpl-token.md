# xMPL

Stake MPL into a Maple owned and audited smart contract and receive xMPL. xMPL is an ERC-20 token and accrues distributed protocol revenues, second-by-second. For more information on how revenues accrued to Maple, see [this section](maple-token-holders/what-fees-are-shared-with-mpl-holders.md).

MPL staked into the xMPL contract is not used as a form of first-loss Pool Cover, lent out or used by other contracts to earn yields.
