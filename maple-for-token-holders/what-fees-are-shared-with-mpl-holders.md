# What fees are shared with MPL holders?

The Maple Treasury earns a portion of the fees generated by the Maple protocol. For the full scope of the fees, please review the Fee section [here](broken-reference).

On a periodic basis, MPL holders will be able to vote on the use of the fees earned by the Treasury. The main options available are:

1. Buyback MPL to be held in treasury
2. Distribute fees to Maple DAO to continue funding operations and growth
3. Distribute fees to MPL holders
