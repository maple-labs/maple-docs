# Governance and Voting

#### **Introduction to Governance** <a href="#introduction-to-governance" id="introduction-to-governance"></a>

The SYRUP token is the governance token for the Maple DAO and governs both the Maple and Syrup ecosystems. All SYRUP tokens, whether staked or unstaked, will be eligible for use in the governance process. Governance voting include decisions on token distribution, recapitalising the Maple Treasury, launching new products, and upgrading the smart contract infrastructure.

Voting is conducted by connecting a wallet with sufficient SYRUP or stSYRUP balance to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/maple.eth). Governance proposals have a 7-day voting window, during which participating wallets can vote for against a proposal. Once a quorum has been reached for or against a decision, and the 7-day voting window is over the vote has passed. If a quorum is not reached, or there are more votes against the proposal than for, the vote is rejected.
