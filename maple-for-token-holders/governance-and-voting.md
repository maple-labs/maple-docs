# Governance and Voting

#### **Introduction to Governance** <a href="#introduction-to-governance" id="introduction-to-governance"></a>

The SYRUP token is the governance token for the Maple ecosystem and aligns stakeholders, drives governance and incentives participation. With the approval of [MIP-019](https://snapshot.box/#/s:maple.eth/proposal/0x8151eb49b56770b882e8d9b6affd4a698572fc6eec31001c74bd977f61c84374), both SYRUP and stSYRUP are eligible for participation in voting.

Governance voting include decisions on token distribution, recapitalising the Maple Treasury, launching new products, and upgrading the smart contract infrastructure.

#### **Voting** <a href="#introduction-to-governance" id="introduction-to-governance"></a>

Voting is conducted by connecting a wallet with sufficient SYRUP or stSYRUP balance to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/maple.eth). Governance proposals have a 7-day voting window, during which participating wallets can vote for against a proposal. Once a quorum has been reached for or against a decision, and the 7-day voting window is over the vote has passed. If a quorum is not reached, or there are more votes against the proposal than for, the vote is rejected.
