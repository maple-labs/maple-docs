# Governance and Voting

#### **Introduction to Governance** <a href="#introduction-to-governance" id="introduction-to-governance"></a>

The SYRUP token is the governance token for the Maple ecosystem and aligns stakeholders, drives governance and incentives participation. In order for SYRUP holders to participate in governance, they will need to stake into stSYRUP to be eligible for participation in voting, as proposed in [MIP-012](https://community.maple.finance/t/mip-012-stsyrup-as-the-sole-governance-token-of-the-maple-finance-ecosystem/348) and [approved by the DAO](https://snapshot.box/#/s:maple.eth/proposal/0x90250c5a7ef3263d88c39007f7ea1a23b4668259e3745581a36b52b5d578746e).&#x20;

Governance voting include decisions on token distribution, recapitalising the Maple Treasury, launching new products, and upgrading the smart contract infrastructure. SYRUP holders can simply stake their SYRUP on [syrup.fi/stake](https://syrup.fi/stake) to participate.&#x20;

Voting is conducted by connecting a wallet with sufficient stSYRUP balance to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/maple.eth). Governance proposals have a 7-day voting window, during which participating wallets can vote for against a proposal. Once a quorum has been reached for or against a decision, and the 7-day voting window is over the vote has passed. If a quorum is not reached, or there are more votes against the proposal than for, the vote is rejected.
