# Drips Rewards

**Drip Rewards Overview**

The introduction of the SYRUP token enhances alignment between the Maple and Syrup ecosystems and enables the protocol to capture value from institutional credit markets through DeFi. The Drips Rewards Program is an innovative rewards program that enables users to earn SYRUP by creating rewards for early participation and long-term commitment.

Each earning period for earning rewards is known as a Season, each lasting one month. Users accumulate Drips on a daily basis, with the base rate established as 1 Drip per 1 USDC per day. Users can then perform actions that will increase this base rate, such as depositing into Syrup using one of our wallet integration partners or leveraging syrupUSDC throughout DeFi. These small actions translate directly into boosted rewards for users.

In addition to these incentives and enhancements, depositors can also boost their Drip rewards by taking a more substantial stake in the Syrup ecosystem:

* A 3-month capital commitment to the Syrup platform will earn a 1.5x multiplier on the user’s base rate.
* A 6-month capital commitment would ensure a 3x multiplier on the user’s base rate.
* These Boosts are designed to reward substantial actions that support the long term growth of Syrup. Boosts can also be compounded by participating in more than one incentivized activity.

**The Drips claiming schedule is released!** SyrupFi users can now see exactly when they will be able to claim their $SYRUP tokens, earned with the Drips they collected. [Drips](https://syrup.gitbook.io/syrup/about-syrup/drips-program) recipients will be eligible to convert their Drips to SYRUP and staked SYRUP (stSYRUP).

The Drips campaign was launched as a way to incentivize early users to join and participate in the overall growth of Maple and SyrupFi. It has been a massive success with more than 250M+ in TVL within a couple of months and integrations with the largest DeFi players including OKX, Pendle and [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/).

All SyrupFi users qualify for Drips and can see their current Drips allocation, broken down per season, on [syrup.fi/drips](http://syrup.fi/drips). **The Pendle and OKX Drips are available for all users to see now as well!**

SyrupFi Season 1, 2 and 3 participants will be able to start claiming their $SYRUP tokens from Drips on December 18th at 2pm UTC on [syrup.fi/drips](http://syrup.fi/drips).

Users in later seasons can see the exact schedule for when their Drips unlock in the table below:



**The $SYRUP tokens will unlock in 3 batches for all users**. Where 1/3 of allocated tokens for the seasons that unlock will be claimable each month for three consecutive months. Unlocks are always at 2pm UTC on the dates referred to in the table above.

**Once the tokens are unlocked, they will be instantly claimable without any vesting**, including for everyone who has committed their deposits. Only the tokens earned during the specified Drips season will unlock. All subsequent SYRUP earned from Drips will unlock at the later dates for those respective seasons.

**Please note that the tokens are only claimable until the next claim date starts.** As an example, for Drips season one, you will be able to claim the allocated SYRUP tokens between the 18th of December at 2pm UTC and the 18th of January at 1:59pm UTC. Unclaimed tokens will be returned to the treasury.

**Drips will continue into 2025**, with further details coming around the program in December. Strong Drips performance is expected to continue.

**SYRUP tokens when claimed can automatically be staked**, which will have users participate in the growth of Maple and SyrupFi.
