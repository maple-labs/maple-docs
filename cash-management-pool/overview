**Risks managed on behalf of Lenders**: The sole use of proceeds is to purchase US Treasury bills and reverse repurchase agreements. Treasury bills are backed by the full faith of the US Government, and are considered one of the safest forms of debt around. Lenders have full recourse over all assets held with a regulated broker.

**How it works**

Room40, a top-tier crypto fund, has established a standalone single purpose vehicle to be the sole borrower from the pool.

The borrower will use proceeds to purchase and hold short-dated US Treasury bills through a SEC and FINRA regulated broker dealer. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio will always be less than 30 days.

Using its broker dealer account, the borrower executes trades, clears, and custodies the Pool’s assets. The Lender Dashboard displays the portfolio of assets held in the brokerage account in real-time

The Cash Management Pool accepts deposits of USDC from non-US Accredited Investors and Entities. Interest automatically compounds and there is no maximum deposit size or lock-up period.

Withdrawals are processed on US banking days between 15:00 - 06:00 Eastern Time the next day. 

Lenders have full recourse via an Account Control Deed to all assets held with regulated broker, enforced by the Security Agent, Maple Foundation.
