# Key Features of the Cash Management Solution:

**Simple and fast access to yield sourced from U.S. Treasury bills**: Backed by U.S. Treasury bills and reverse repurchase agreements, the Pool targets a net APY of the current Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), less fees and expenses. It takes between 10-15 minutes for Accredited Investors to onboard. [Begin onboarding here](https://form.typeform.com/to/u3n8Q8ga?#pool=CASHMNGTUSDC).

**Manage withdrawals and accounting from the Lender Dashboard**: So Lenders can confidently manage cash flows, withdrawals will be serviced every day the US banking system is open. Monthly Interest Statements can be downloaded at any time and used for record keeping and accounting. Large Lenders and Treasury Managers will be assigned an Account Manager, [speak to the team](https://form.typeform.com/to/KhVOWR5W#pool_name=Cash%20Management%20USDC).

**Monitor and measure performance 24/7**: The Lender Dashboard provides a real-time view into the borrower’s portfolio of Treasury bills held with a regulated broker, alongside returns to date so Lenders can see compounded interest update in real-time.

**Designed by Maple, in partnership with leading 3rd parties**: The team at Room40 are experts in trading treasuries and will trade, custody and clear from an account with a regulated broker. Maple has a track record in providing secure and scalable products on top of best in class smart contract infrastructure and was recently awarded a 92% Safety Score by DeFi Safety [full report](https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/533).

**Risks managed on behalf of Lenders**: The sole Borrower from the Pool is only permitted to invest in U.S. Treasury bills and reverse repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury bills. U.S. Treasury bills are backed by the full faith of the US Government, and are considered one of the safest forms of debt around.

# How it works

Room40, a top-tier crypto fund, has established a standalone single purpose vehicle to be the sole Borrower from the Pool.

The Borrower converts the USDC or USDT loan proceeds to USD proceeds  and sends the funds to a prime brokerage account. Using its prime brokerage account, the Borrower invests in U.S. Treasury bills and reverse repurchase agreements. The weighted average maturity of the Borrower's portfolio, transparently displayed on the Lender Dashboard, is capped at 30 days under the Master Loan Agreement.

The Cash Management Pool accepts deposits of USDC and USDT from Accredited Investors. Interest automatically compounds and there is no maximum deposit size or lock-up period. Withdrawals are processed on US banking days between 15:00 - 06:00 Eastern Time.
